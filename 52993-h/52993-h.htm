<p><b><a id="Transcribers_notes"></a>Transcriber’s notes</b>:</p>

<p>Several features of this book are unusual: it has two slightly
different lists of contents which do not correspond precisely with
the text, and there is a preface midway through the book; it has
confusing page numbering (omitted from this transcription) which
restarts in successive sections of the text using mixed arabic and
roman numerals; the text displays an unusual mixture of italics,
small capitals, full capitals, and variable letter spacing<span class="epubonly"> (some of
which do not display correctly on handheld reading devices)</span>; much
of the spelling is archaic, and both spelling and punctuation are
inconsistent. Some obvious typesetting errors have been corrected
(<a href="#Spelling_corrections">see list</a>) but the spelling and
punctuation otherwise remains true to the original text.</p>

<p>In this transcription a black dotted underline marks a hyperlink to
a section of text or to a footnote (links are also highlighted when the mouse
pointer hovers over them).</p>

<p class="epubonly">A title has been added to the original blank
cover.</p>

<p>This Gentleman might be

of Mr <span class="smcap">Isaac Beckett</span>, Surgeon
of <i>Abington</i> in <i>Berkshire</i>,
where he was born in

<p>He received his Education

Master of the excellent Free
Grammar-School belonging
to that Town, served four
Years of his Apprenticeship
with his Father, and the
three last with Mr <i>Joseph Bateman</i>,
of St <i>Thomas’s Hospital</i>
in <i>Southwark</i>.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Beckett</span> died, <span class="smcap">Sir</span>,
at his Sister’s House in <i>Abington</i>,
<i>November</i> the 25th 1738,
in the 54th Year of his Age,
and lies interred in St <i>Hellen</i>’s
Church there.</p>

<p>Of this his Native Place,
he drew up a <i>Brief Account

Surgeon. To these Remarks Mr <i>Beckett</i>
subjoined, <i>An Account of a</i> Wound <i>of
the</i> Brain <i>by</i> a Bullet; <i>with Reflections
thereon</i>. And at the End of this <span class="smcap">Tract</span>,
Mr <i>Beckett</i> gave an <i>Advertisement</i> that He
had almost ready for the Press, <i>Annotations
and Practical Observations on the
Learned and Ingenious Monsieur</i> <span class="smcap">Gendron</span>’s
<i>Enquiries into the Nature, Knowledge and
Cure of</i> <span class="smcap">Cancers</span>.</p>

<p>II. <i>In the Year</i> 1711, He published <span class="smcap">New
Discoveries</span> <i>relating to the Cure of</i> <span class="smcap">Cancers</span>.
<i>Wherein the painful Methods of cutting
them off, and consuming them by Caustics
are rejected, and that of dissolving the
Cancerous Substance</i> is recommended; <i>with
various Instances of his Success in</i> this
Practice <i>on Persons reputed incurable.
Also a Solution of Four curious Problems concerning</i>
<span class="smcap">Cancers</span>, viz. I. Whether the
Cancerous Juice <i>is corrosive or not</i>. II. <i>Whether</i>
Cancers <i>are contagious or not</i>. III. <i>Whether
if the extirpating a</i> Cancerous Breast
<i>happens to be successful, it ought to be looked
upon as a Consequence of performing the
Operation better than our Predecessors</i>.
IV. <i>Whether a</i> Salivation <i>will Cure a</i> Cancer.</p>

<p><i>This Treatise came to a</i> Second Edition
<i>the following Year</i> 1712: <i>To which, besides
some Corrections</i>, Mr <span class="smcap">Beckett</span> <i>added</i> <span class="smcap">Two</span>
<i>other Problems with their Solutions</i>, viz.
V. Whether <i>Cancers</i> are curable by <i>Caustics</i>.
VI. Whether <i>Cancers</i> are curable by
<i>Internal Medicines</i>. In this Piece all that
he promised relating to <span class="smcap">Gendron</span> is inserted.
And to the present <i>Third Edition</i> He
subjoined, by way of <i>Postscript</i>, a very
valuable <i>Receipt</i> for the Cure of <i>Cancers</i>,
which he informs us was communicated to
him by his late eminent Brother Surgeon
Mr <i>Dobyns</i> of <i>Snow-Hill</i>. He had it from
Mr <i>Pain</i> a Gentleman of <i>Northamptonshire</i>,
in whose Family it had been, in the
highest Esteem, for above 200 Years.
Mr <i>Beckett</i> likewise adds, that he transcribed
it from the Original <i>Manuscript</i>.</p>

<p>At the End of the <i>Second Edition</i> of his
<i>Treatise</i> on <i>Cancers</i>, Mr <i>Beckett</i> gave an
<i>Advertisement</i> that “He was then preparing
for the Press, <i>Chirurgical Collections</i>,
which would consist of His own <i>Observation</i>
of <i>uncommon Cases</i>, also, the most
curious things relating to Surgery, taken
from the Performances of the <i>German
Eruditi</i>, in their <i>Acta Lipsiæ</i>, the <i>Miscellanea
Curiosa</i>, <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>.
<i>Memoirs for the Curious</i>, <i>Voyages</i>, <i>Travels</i>,
<i>Natural Histories of Counties</i>, and
many other things that would afford
useful Observations. In this Collection
was to be a great number of Figures of
Cases, Instruments, Machines, <i>&amp;c</i>. all
curiously engraven on Copper Plates.
This Undertaking was wholly designed
for the Improvement of the Art of
Surgery; and the <i>Introduction</i> to it was
to give an Account of our famous <i>English</i>
Writers in <i>Physic</i> and <i>Surgery</i>, for
many hundred Years past.”</p>

<p>The great and deserved Practice which
attended Mr <i>Beckett</i>’s <i>New Method of curing
Cancers</i>, obliged him to postpone the Publication
of his <i>Chirurgical Collections</i>, as above
recited; and which, upon a mature Deliberation,
he changed into a much more extensive
and useful Design; and, by Mr <i>Innys</i> at the
West-End of St <i>Paul</i>’s, and Mr <i>Hooke</i> in
<i>Fleet-street</i>, Booksellers, He published <i>Proposals
for printing by Subscription in 2 Volumes</i>
4to, An Account of the Lives, Characters,
and Writings, <i>both Manuscript and Printed</i>,
of the most eminent <i>British</i> Authors in
<i>Physic</i>, <i>Surgery</i>, <i>Anatomy</i>, <i>Pharmacy</i>, <i>Botany</i>
and <i>Chemistry</i>, from the Conquest to
the Year 1721. To which was to be added,
A large Collection of Records, principally
taken from the <i>Tower</i>, containing Grants of
particular Favours and Privileges to the most
noted <i>Physicians</i> and <i>Surgeons</i> by the Kings
of this Realm for many hundred Years;
whereby, besides other curious Affairs not
to be met with elsewhere, the Time in
which they lived was to be ascertained,
as to several of them, has hitherto remained
absolutely undetermined. The whole
faithfully collected and reduced to the most
exact Order of Time.</p>

<p>This Work was proposed at the Price of
one Guinea in Sheets.</p>

<p>Between the Years 1717 and 1720, Mr
<i>Beckett</i> published in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
Three Letters concerning the <i>History
of the Antiquity of the Venereal Disease</i>.
I. To Dr <i>Douglass</i>. II. To Dr <i>Wagstaffe</i>.
III. To Dr <i>Halley</i>. Proving <i>That Disease</i> to
have been <i>known</i> and <i>cured</i> in <i>England</i> long
before the Discovery of the <i>West-Indies</i>.</p>

<p>Of these Pieces Dr <i>Astruc</i>, a <i>French</i>
Physician, full of the Vanity peculiar to his
Countrymen, seems doubtful as to their
Proof, because he had never seen the Manuscripts,
nor rare printed Authorities, cited by
Mr <i>Beckett</i>; and treating of Dr <i>Turner</i>’s
<i>Syphilis</i>, speaks slightly of that Gentleman,
because he is of the same Opinion with
Mr <i>Beckett</i>.</p>

<p>From the Publication of a small Pamphlet
consisting but of 24 Pages, 8vo, Intituled,
“A <i>Letter</i> from a Gentleman at <i>Rome</i>, to
his Friend in <i>London</i>, giving an Account
of some very surprizing <i>Cures</i> in the
<i>King’s-Evil</i> by the <i>Touch</i>, (of the Chevalier
<i>De St George</i>) lately effected in the
Neighbourhood of that City, 1721.
Wherein is contained the compleatest
History of this <i>miraculous Power</i>, formerly
practiced by the <i>Kings</i> of <i>England</i>,
ever yet made public; the <i>Certainty</i> of
<i>which</i> is confirmed by the most eminent
Writers of this Nation, both <i>Catholics</i>
and <i>Protestants</i>, as, <i>Malmsbury</i>, <i>Alured</i>,
<i>Brompton</i>, <i>Polydore Virgil</i>, <i>Harpsfield</i>,
&amp;c. and Drs <i>Tooker</i>, <i>Heylin</i>, Mr
<i>Collier</i>, Mr <i>Echard</i>, &amp;c. <i>Translated</i> out
of the <i>Italian</i>.” And the following Motto
prefixed by the Catholic Translator, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p><i>King</i> Edward the Confessor, <i>was the first
that cured this Distemper, and from him it
has descended as an Hereditary Miracle upon
All his Successors</i>. To dispute the <i>Matter
of Fact</i>, is to go to the <i>Excess of Scepticism</i>,
to <i>deny our Senses</i>, and to be <i>incredulous</i>
even to <i>Ridiculousness</i>. See <i>Collier</i>’s
Ecclesiast. History Vol. I.</p>

<p>Mr <i>Beckett</i> took an immediate Occasion
to explode all these Legendary Assertions,
and fully proved the Truth of Mr <i>Collier</i>’s
positive <i>ipse dixit</i> to lye on the other
side of the Question, in two Letters which
he Published, I. To Dr <i>Steigerthal</i>, intituled
“A Free and Impartial Enquiry into the Antiquity
and Efficacy of <i>Touching</i> for the
<i>King’s-Evil</i>.” II. To Sir <i>Hans Sloane</i> in
“order to a compleat Confutation of that
supposed <i>supernatural Power</i> descending
from <i>Edward the Confessor</i> to the succeeding
<i>Kings</i> of <i>England</i>. Also, A
Dissertation concerning the ancient Method
made use of, for the curing <i>Diseases</i>
by <i>Charms</i>, <i>Amulets</i>, &amp;c.” To which is
added, <i>A Collection of Records</i>.</p>

<p>When in the Year 1722, it was feared
that we should be visited with the
<i>Plague</i> in <i>England</i>, after it had raged so
violently at <i>Marseilles</i> in <i>France</i>; Dr <i>Mead</i>
published his <i>Preservative</i> against <i>Pestilential
Distempers</i>. And, among several other
<i>New</i> Pieces written, and <i>Old</i> ones revived
upon this Occasion, Mr <i>Beckett</i> voluntarily
lent his helping Hand for the good of his
Country, by giving his Judgment, and Publishing
(Anonymously) <i>A Collection of Pieces</i>
Written during the <i>Plagues</i>, which happened
in the two last Centuries.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Beckett</span>’s <i>Chirurgical Observations</i>,
made at St <i>Thomas</i>’s Hospital <i>Southwark</i>;
Published last Summer, were prepared for
the Press by Himself, and Inscribed to Sir
<i>Hans Sloane</i> and the <i>Royal Society</i>.</p>

<p class="tac ls02em mt2em">TO</p>

<p class="tac ls02em fs180">Sir HANS SLOANE.</p>

<p class="ml1em"><i>Honoured Sir</i>,</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">THE</em> last Paper Mr <i>Beckett</i> ever wrote,
was an Address to you for a private
Favour; in which he says, he likewise had
reason to believe that Dr <i>Mead</i> would be
his Friend. He therein acquainted you
that he had, “contracted such a Cold by sitting
to write, with his Neck against a
North-Window, as he feared would be
his Death; and if so, <i>adds he</i>, it may be
said I dye a Martyr to the <i>Improvement</i>
of the History of <i>Physic and Surgery</i>.”
Thus concluded his Paper which he did not
live to sign; it was found among his <i>Collections</i>
relating to the <i>Lives of the British
Physicians, Surgeons</i>, &amp;c. He had copied
fair, for the Press, the greatest part of his
Papers; and tho’ it was an <i>unfinished Work</i>,
yet from his Character, and the great
Pains he had taken, I knew it would be
very acceptable to the Public. Accordingly
I put it to the Press, and intended to have
published it in two Volumes in <i>Octavo</i>. Young
Dr <i>B</i> * * * *, was recommended to me as
a proper Editor: I sent for him and shewed
him the Papers; but soon found, that he
was much too young both in Character and
Ability for such an Undertaking. I printed
one Sheet, in <i>Octavo</i>, (of which there
were but two Copies taken off) upon this,
Dr <i>Milward</i> informed me, that he had been
for some Years compiling <i>An Universal
History of Physic</i>. He expressed his Desire
of purchasing Mr <i>Beckett</i>’s Papers, and being
fully convinced, from his Learning and
Candour, that he would do Justice to the
<i>Author</i>’s Memory, I readily let him have
them. And Sir, that you, might in some
measure be apprized of Mr <i>Beckett</i>’s <span class="smcap">Plan</span>,
I have to this Volume prefixed his Introduction

<p class="tac mrl5pc"><i>Concerning the Antient State of Learning,
and the Antiquity of the Practice of</i> Physic
<i>and</i> Surgery.</p>


<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt"><i>BRITAIN</i></em> has been very happy in
furnishing the World, in very early
Times, with a great Number of famous
and learned Men. Of the first Sort were
the <i>Druydæ</i>, who, it is said, had their
Original and Name from <i>Druys Sarronius</i>
the fourth King of the <i>Celts</i>, who died
<i>Anno Mundi</i> 2069. Next the <i>Bardi</i>, who
celebrated the illustrious Deeds of famous
Men, who had their Name from <i>Bardus
Druydus</i> the fifth King of the <i>Celts</i>. <i>Cæsar</i>
assures us, (and a noble Testimony it is)
that the Learning of the <i>Druydi</i>, was first
invented in <i>Britain</i>, and from thence transferred
to <i>France</i>; and that, in his Time,
those of <i>France</i> came over hither to be instructed.
A celebrated <i>German</i> Writer, as
quoted by Mr <i>Ashmole</i> in the Prolegomena
to his <i>Theat. Chem.</i> says, that when the
World was troubled with Pannonic Invasions,
<i>England</i> flourished in the Knowledge of all
good Arts, and was able to send her learned
Men into other Countries to propagate Learning:
And instances in <i>Boniface</i>, a <i>Devonshire</i>
Man, and <i>Willeboard</i>, a <i>Northern</i>
Man, which were sent into <i>Germany</i> for
those Purposes. Mr <i>John Leland</i>, a famous
Antiquary, in the Reign of King
<i>Henry</i> VII, who was excellently well acquainted
with our <i>British</i> Authors, assures
us, upon his own Knowledge, that we
have had a great Number of excellent Wits
and learned Writers, who, besides their
great Proficiency in Languages, were well
acquainted with the Liberal Sciences. And
Bishop <i>Nicholson</i>, in his Historical Library
says, I think we may without Vanity affirm,
that hardly any Kingdom in the
World has out-done <i>England</i>, either in the
Number or Goodness of her Authors; and
that even in the darkest Ages our Lamps
shone always as bright as any of our Neighbourhood.
When School-Divinity was in
Fashion, we had our <i>Doctores Subtiles</i>, <i>Irrefragabiles</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> But as the History of
the Learning of this Nation in general is
not my present Design, I shall confine myself
more particularly to what relates to
Physic and Surgery. An Historical Account
of the Antiquity and Progress of
which Faculties, with the successive Improvements
they have received, has not
hitherto been attempted by any Hand.
And indeed the Difficulty which must attend
an Undertaking of this Nature, must
be very great, by reason of the little Knowledge
we are able to get, in this Kind, from
those Manuscripts which yet remain among
us. The ancient <i>Britains</i>, who went without
Cloaths, may be very well presumed to
live without Physic; but external Accidents
they must be liable to, as well in their Wars
as from other Causes; and History informs
us, they had Methods of Cure for such Misfortunes.
The <i>Saxons</i>, while they possessed
<i>England</i>, had their Leeches, a sort of Surgeons,
but very little skilled in Methodical
Practice. But under the <i>Normans</i> that
Science began to be much more improved.
About this Time the <i>Monks</i> and <i>Fryars</i>,
and others in Religious Orders, out of a pretended
Charity to their suffering Fellow-Creatures,
intruded themselves into the
Practice of Physic and Surgery, and continued
it many Years, notwithstanding the
Decree of the Council of <i>Tours</i> in 1163,
where Pope <i>Alexander</i> III. presided; which
forbids any Religious Persons going out of
their Cloisters, to hear the Lectures in Law
or Physic; and that it is absolutely forbidden,
that any Sub-Deacon, Deacon, or
Priest, exercise any Part of Surgery in which
actual Cauteries or Incisions are required.
Most of the Physicians who practised in
<i>England</i> about this Time, were likewise
well skilled in the Mathematics and other
Parts of Philosophy; but the Surgeons of
those Times were so much addicted to Astrology,
as make some Parts of their Writings
very obscure. After this both Physic
and Surgery began to flourish much more,
by the public Encouragement given very
early by many of our Kings to several of
the Practitioners in both Faculties, as will
appear by the List of our Kings Physicians
and Surgeons, to be inserted in it’s proper
Place. <i>Hector Boëtius</i> informs us, that
<i>Josina</i>, King of <i>Scotland</i>, who lived above
a hundred Years before our Saviour, well
understood the Nature of <i>Scotch</i> Plants, and
their Use in Physic and Chirurgery; and
<i>John Bale</i>, afterwards Bishop of <i>Ossory</i> in
<i>Ireland</i>, assures us, he wrote a Book, <i>de
Herbarum Viribus</i>. <i>Buchanan</i> relates, the
<i>Scotch</i> Nobility were anciently very expert
in Chirurgery, and it is particularly remarked
of <i>James</i> IV, King of <i>Scotland</i>, <i>Quod
vulnera scientissime tractaret</i>. It is said,
that when <i>Scribonius Largus</i> attended the
Emperor <i>Claudius</i> in his Expedition to <i>Britany</i>,
he wrote a <i>British</i> Herbal, or Description
of divers Plants in this Island.
And our most learned and famous King <i>Alfred</i>,
is said to have written a Book upon
Aristotle <i>de Plantis</i>. <i>Cinfrid</i>, a famous
Physician, is mentioned by that early Writer
<i>Venerable Bede</i>, in his <i>Histor. Ecclesiasticar.</i>
page 307, 308. And <i>Ernulphus</i>, another
eminent Physician, in the Time of <i>Nigellus</i>,
the second Bishop of <i>Ely</i>, is likewise recorded
in the <i>Anglia Sacra</i>, Vol. I. p. 625.
Many more Particulars might, in all Probability,
have been met with relating to
my present Design, had not one very great
Misfortune attended the Suppression of the
Abbies, which was the Destruction of a
prodigious Number of Manuscripts. <i>John
Bale</i>, before-mentioned, though an utter
Enemy to Popery and Monastic Institution,
remonstrates against this Piece of Barbarity,
in pretty strong Terms, to King <i>Edward</i> VI.
Covetousness, says he, was at that Time so
busy about private Commodity, that public
Wealth was not any where regarded. A
Number of them, which purchased those
superstitious Mansions, reserved of those
Library-Books, some to serve their Jacks,
some to scour their Candlestics, and some
to rub their Boots, and some they sold to
the Grocers and Soap-sellers, and some they
sent over Sea to the Book-binders, not in
small Numbers, but at Times whole Ships
full. Yea, the Universities of this Realm,
are not all clear in this detestable Fact: But
cursed is the Belly which seeketh to be fed
with so ungodly Gains, and so deeply
shameth his natural Country. I know, says
he, a Merchantman (which shall at this
time be nameless) that bought the Contents
of two noble Libraries for forty Shillings
Price; a Shame it is to be spoken. This
Stuff hath he occupied instead of gray Paper,
by the Space of more than these ten Years,
and yet he has Store enough for these ten
Years to come. A prodigious Example is
this, and to be abhorred of all Men, which
love their Nation as they should do. Yea,
what may bring our Nation to more Shame
and Rebuke, than to have it noised abroad,
that we are Despisers of Learning? I judge
this to be true, and utter it with Heaviness,
that neither the <i>Britons</i>, under the <i>Romans</i>
and <i>Saxons</i>, nor yet the <i>English</i> People under
the <i>Danes</i> and <i>Normans</i>, had ever such
Damage of their learned Monuments, as we
have seen in our Time. Our Posterity may
well curse this wicked Fact of our Age, this
unseasonable Spoil of <i>England’s</i> most noble
Antiquities. <i>Bale</i>’s Declaration upon <i>Leland</i>’s
Journal, published 1549. And Dr
<i>Thomas Fuller</i>, in his Church History, speaking
of the same Thing, tells us, Divinity
was prophaned, Mathematics suffered for
Correspondence with evil Spirits, Physic was
maimed, and a Riot committed on the Law
itself. However, notwithstanding this Devastation
which was then made among our
Manuscripts, our Colleges, and some of
our Libraries, will furnish us with a great
Number relating to almost all Parts of Learning:
Some of which, more especially the
most ancient ones, I shall here first give a
Catalogue of, and then some more modern
ones, confining myself to those which more
especially relate to Physic and Chirurgery.

<p>I proceed now to give an Account of some
of our early Writers, besides those already
mentioned. And first of <i>Maugantius</i>, who
was by Birth a <i>Briton</i>, a famous Physician
and Mathematician; who, says <i>Leland</i>, for
his eminent Learning, was made President
of a noble College (in those Days) of two
hundred Philosophers; which <i>Geofrey</i> of
<i>Monmouth</i> extols to the Skies, under the
Name of <i>Legionum Urbs</i>; which <i>Bale</i> supposes
to be <i>Chester</i>, excelling all other <i>British</i>
Cities, at that Time, in Wealth and
<i>Roman</i> Structures. This Place being most
pleasantly situated, Astrologers, and other
Artists, settled in it to observe the Motions
of the Stars, and undertook to forewarn
Mankind from the Comets, and certain Indications
of the Planets, what should
come to pass. Hence <i>Maugantius</i>, said to
be superior to all others in this Art, being
questioned by King <i>Vortiger</i>, whose chief
Physician he was, about the prodigious
Conception of <i>Ambrose Merlin</i>, after a Recital
of various Philosophical Reasons, did,
at length, it seems, give him Satisfaction
therein. This Person, who was the most
renowned Scholar of his Country, and who
is said to have composed several Books,
flourished in the Year of Christ 470, when
King <i>Vortiger</i> was much distressed by the
invading <i>Anglo-Saxons</i>. I have before observed,
that there were several Dignitaries
of the Papal Communion as well as those
of inferior Orders, besides the <i>Monks</i>, who
very early took upon them to practise Physic;
and that they were absolutely forbid to
exercise that Profession, by the <i>Roman</i> Assembly,
in 1139. Of this Sort was <i>Frabricius</i>,
or <i>Faricius</i>, as he is sometimes
written, who practised Physic not long before
this Time. He was the eighteenth
Abbot of the Monastery of <i>Abington</i> in
<i>Berkshire</i>; to whose Care <i>Godfrey de Vere</i>
committed himself, to be cured of a grievous
Disease he then laboured under; and,
as an Acknowledgment for the Care the
Abbot had taken of him, he bequeathed
to the Abbey before-mentioned, the Church
belonging to his Estate, in the Village of
<i>Kensington</i>, near <i>London</i>, with 240 Acres
of Land, <i>&amp;c.</i> which was confirmed by
the King; a Copy of which Grant will be
given in the Antiquities of that Town, and
the History of it’s Abbey. This Abbot departed
this Life the VIIth of the Calends
of <i>March</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1117. Soon after him
flourished <i>Athelardus</i>, a Monk of <i>Bath</i>,
who was so diligent in searching out the
Mysteries and Causes of Natural Things,
that he deserves to be equalled with some
of the ancient Philosophers. Having a
very promising Genius, while very young,
and continuing, as he grew up, to improve
his Parts, and fit himself for great Affairs,
he left his native Soil, and, with much Alacrity,
went to visit foreign Parts. In his
Travels through <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Arabia</i>, having
found many Things he sought after, he
came Home again with good Fruit of his
Labours and Improvement of his Learning.
He was, without Dispute, in Philosophy,
Astronomy, Physic, Mathematics, and
Rhetoric, no ordinary Proficient. Some
of his Works he Dedicated to <i>Richard</i>,
Bishop of <i>Bayeux</i>: In the first Work he
treats of the Principles, Qualities, and Effects
of Natural Things, against the vain
Opinions of the old Philosophers. In the
Preface it appears, he wrote in the Year
1130, under the Reign of <i>Henry</i> I. I
might here enlarge upon the great Fame
and Merits of <i>John Giles</i>, a Native of St
<i>Albans</i>, who made such Progress in the
Study of Physic, that he was made Professor
of that Faculty at <i>Paris</i> and <i>Montpelier</i>,
and Physician to <i>Philip</i>, King of <i>France</i>.
After his Return to his own Country, he
was, according to <i>Matthew Paris</i>, consulted
by <i>Robert Grosthead</i>, the learned Bishop
of <i>Lincoln</i>, in his last Illness; of which he
died in 1253. He has written, <i>De re Medica</i>,
and <i>de Prognosticis</i>, and some other
Things. He flourished about the Year 1230,
in the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> III. <i>Hugh de
Eversham</i>, deserves in this Place to be remembred,
who was a Man of great Learning,
a Physician by Profession, and perhaps
the best of his Age. He was well
known in many Countries, being a great
Frequenter of the Universities. With the
severer Studies of his Art, he mingled the
pleasant Science of the Mathematics, and particularly
Geometry and Astronomy. This
made him known to many in <i>France</i> and
<i>Italy</i>, and among the rest, to Pope <i>Martin</i>
IV, who invited him, by Letters, to come
to him, and solve some Questions in Physic,
which were then newly started: Accordingly
he went without Delay, and performed
what was required readily and learnedly. He
published <i>Super Opere Febrium Isaac</i>. <i>Medicinales
Canones</i>. <i>Problemata quædam</i>, and
some other Things. He flourished the
Year 1281; when he was created Cardinal
Presbyter of St <i>Laurence</i>, by the said Pope
<i>Martin</i>, in the Reign of <i>Edward</i> I. He
is said to have died by Poison at <i>Rome</i>, <i>Anno</i>
1287; although <i>Cicæonius</i>, to palliate
this Matter, says he died of the Plague.</p>

<p class="dropcap1">I do not question but you have had the
Curiosity to read over a very <i>remarkable
Case in Surgery</i>, not only upon Account of
the Recommendation the Name of the <span class="nowrap">Author<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
gives it, but partly because I know you
have been for a long time of opinion, That
this Age wou’d distinguish it self by the Advances
that <i>Medicine</i> has, and will receive;
I need not observe, to a Man of your Capacity,
how just, according to my Opinion,
our Author has been in relating all the Particulars
of the Case he gives us the History
of: Nor need I intimate to you how peculiarly
the Prescriptions were adapted to the several
alterations that were observable in that little
Patient: I will only take the freedom to
make some Remarks on a considerable Circumstance,
which perhaps we shall find obstructed
so methodical a Procedure, in order
for a Cure.</p>

<p>Our Author is of opinion, <i>That his Death
was owing to the effused Blood from some Vessel
upon the</i> Pia Mater, <i>which had been ruptured
by the Concussion or Shock of the said
Vessel, from the Force of the Blow; which
Blood pent in (for want of a Discharge) had
formed an Abscess, thereby deluging the Surface
of the Brain with Matter: And this,
tho’ continually draining off thro’ the Orifice
in the upper Membrane, yet some part thereof
lying beyond the Elastic Power of the said
Membrane to raise up, and out of the Reach
of Medicine to deterge and mundifie, was at
length imbibed by the Vessels, where missing the
Salutary Crisis, sometimes observed in the
Empieme and Pleuritic Cases, it was conveyed
by the Circulation to the Heart, and at length,
we are to suppose, somehow effected the Nervous
System, bringing on the fatal Spasm.</i></p>

<p>Thus you see, <i>Sir</i>, how plain and consequential
the Account of the Child’s Death
is; but even here, I hope, I shall do no Injustice
to the Author, if I inform you, I
cannot perswade my self that the Matter was
imbibed by the Vessels, purely because <i>some
part thereof lay beyond the Elastic Power of
the</i> Dura Mater <i>to raise up, and out of the
Reach of Medicine to deterge and mundifie</i>,
as our Author’s Words are; but that it is
reasonable to believe, that some part of it
was reassumed by the Vessels, when it could
no longer discharge it self as before; for if
you will give your self the trouble of looking
back to the 32d Page, you will find,
that no sooner was the <i>Orifice choaked up by
a caked Matter</i>, but the mischievous Effects
of the Suppression of the Discharge soon began
to discover themselves by the Rigours
the Child was attended with; and we find
our Author soon after fearful of such a thing.</p>

<p>By this we may see how circumspect we
ought always to be, lest we interrupt the
Design of Nature when she is about to expel
any morbifick Matter, the ill Effects that
attend it oftentimes discovering themselves
after different Manners; We look upon a
continued Discharge of Matter to be, as it
were, a natural Evacuation, and that it’s immediate
Stoppage, without other Means, being
made use of to divert and evacuate it, to
be succeeded by a greater Fulness and Distention
of all the Vessels, as is observable upon
the Suppression of the <i>Menses</i>, <i>Hemorrhoides</i>,
or <i>insensible Transpiration</i>, there is
this Difference to be observed that the ill Accidents
that attend the Stoppage of the Discharge
of Matter are not so much owing to
the Distention and Plenitude of the Vessels,
but according to the ill Quality of it, ’tis
disposed to render the Patient feverish more
or less, which is generally ushered in by Rigours,
and sometimes succeeded by Spasmodic
Contractions.</p>

<p>For a further Illustration of this, we will
take the liberty to relate the Case of a Man
of about Forty Years of Age, who was for
a considerable time incommoded in his Business,
by reason of a violent Contusion he
had received on the Upper-part of his Left
Arm, a little below the Shoulder: After
some time it was succeeded by an Apostemation,
upon the opening of which I was
informed, a considerable Quantity of Matter
discharged, which was not of any ill Colour
or Smell, the Matter continuing to make
its Exit the same way for several Weeks, at
length formed a <i>Sinus</i>, which might be
easily traced to the Upper and Fore-part of
the <i>Os Humeri</i>. The external Orifice of
this was endeavoured to be dilated, but it
not only put the Patient to a great deal of
Pain, but pent in the Matter, and caused
the contiguous Parts to tumifie very much.
About this time the Axillary Glands began
to swell and pain him, and by their Pressure
on the Limphaticks the whole Arm became
Oedematous; soon after some part of the
Matter made it’s way out under the Arm,
upon which it almost ceased to flow from the
<i>Sinus</i> on the upper-part of it. In short, upon
this the Patient found himself very much
indisposed, he lost his Appetite, was attended
with Shiverings, became feverish, and at
length died violently convulsed.</p>

<p>On Dissection we found the Surface of
the Lungs to be interspersed with blackish
Specks, the left Lobe adhered to the <i>Pleura</i>,
and the <i>Pericordium</i> contained a much
greater Quantity of Liquor than usual,
though its Colour was natural. The Right
Auricle and Ventricle of the Heart were
very much distended, and the Diameter of
the <i>Arteria Pulmonaris</i> considerably enlarged:
on the Division of the Integuments of
the Abdomen, a very large Quantity of yellowish
fœtid Matter discharged it self,
which was somewhat viscid; we found that
the Intestines floated in this, for the Abdomen
was full of it. In the lower-part of the
Concave Side of the Liver there was a very
large Abscess discovered, which contained a
Fluid of the same Colour and Consistence
with that which we took notice of before.
There was an Orifice in the lower part of
the Abscess capable of admitting the End of
one’s Finger; by which, without doubt,
Matter discharged it self into the Abdomen.
The Spleen was of a very odd Figure: On
it’s convex Side there were a Multitude of
Streaks, that proceeded from all Parts of it,
and centered in one Point, which proceeded
only from the Disposition of the Fibres
of it’s internal Membrane. It was almost
full of Blood, which in the middle was corrupted,
and stank abominably. After it
was cleared from the contiguous Parts to
which it adhered, and taken out of the
Body, it weighed four Pounds and a half.</p>

<p>There might have been something more
observable upon the Dissection of this Body,
but the short time that was allotted for it
did not give us an Opportunity of making
that strict Enquiry as seemed to be necessary.
<i>Blancard</i>. in his <i>Anat. Pract. Rationalis</i>,
<i>p. 252</i>. has much such an Observation as
this which we have related. See likewise
<i>Schenckius</i>, <i>Lib.</i> 3. <i>Obs</i> 26. But I do not
doubt, <i>Sir</i>, but you have made some curious
Remarks on Cases of this Nature, tho’
I am pretty positive you will agree with me
in this, That the immediate Cause of the
Death of the Person we have been speaking
of, was the giving a sudden Check to the
Discharge of the Matter. It was the Work
of Nature in this Case (and what she was
endeavouring to perform) to disburden herself
of those disproportionate and offensive
Particles, which by their Continuance in
the Body would but have occasioned an irregular
Motion of the Fluids, and consequently
a Discomposure of it’s whole Frame:
For the animal Body being nothing else but
a Congeries of Canals, filled with different
Liquors, it must necessarily suffer very much,
and it’s Actions be irregular, if any Heterogeneous
Particles become incorporated therewith.
We must here allow, that in Discharges
of Matter of a long Continuance,
sometimes the Diameters of the Fibres and
Vessels may be so much enlarged, that the
nutritious Juices may be thrown out with
the other, and so occasion a general Emaciation:
But this may be easily rectified at the
Beginning, without Detriment to the Patient,
by making use of some spirituous and
moderately astringent Remedies, to recover
the natural Tone of the too lax Fibres and
Vessels, and give the Matter a proper Consistence.
It is to be observed in such Cases as
these are, that the Part from whence the
Matter discharges, if it be the Leg or
Thigh, first loses it’s former Fulness and
Dimensions, tho’ soon after there appears an
Emaciation of the whole Body. Such an
Abscess as we discovered in the Liver of the
Person before mentioned, we are inclined to
believe might have been found in the Child,
had the Abdomen been dissected; for several
Authors have assured us, it has frequently
been observed to be the Consequent of Fractures
of the Skull, tho’ I am apt to believe
it never happens, but when the Matter has
received a Check in it’s Discharge.</p>

<p>I shall now take the Liberty to observe,
that the imprudent Application of Repellents
to some Tumours, and inconsiderate
Healing of old Ulcers, with the unhappy
Method of Procedure, in order to the Cure
of some Diseases, very often discover themselves,
by their being succeeded by very ill
Effects. <i>Non tamen in omnibus Huxionibus
repellentia adhibere licet,</i> (says <i>Sennertus</i>)
<i>Partibus ignobilibus, præcipue iis, ad quas
natura interdum humores protrudere solet, ut
sunt Glandulæ post aures, &amp; in collo, sub
axillis, in inguinibus adhibenda non sunt, ne
humor ex iis repulsus ad partes principes &amp;
nobiles feratur.</i></p>

<p>The same Author informs us in his <i>Paralipom.</i>
<i>ad lib.</i> 5. <i>Pract. Med.</i> of a Boy,
fourteen Years of Age, that died upon the
Accession of an Epileptic Fit, which was
caused by the striking in of the Scab by the
imprudent Use of Liniments. And <i>Baglivi</i>
allows, that the irregular Cure of the same
Disease may be succeeded by a Spitting of
Blood, an Apoplexy, Dropsy, lingering Fevers,
<i>&amp;c.</i> The Healing of old Ulcers, without
having a Respect to those Circumstances
that ought to precede such an Undertaking,
generally lays the Foundation for a Train
of mischievous Accidents; for the Patient
soon begins to be sensible of an Unactiveness
of the whole Body, is sleepy, has a
weak Digestion, Head-ach, and is feverish,
which is attended with very profuse Night-Sweats;
and these we have several times
observed to be the Forerunners of the Patient’s
Death, though sometimes all these ill
Accidents may be prevented by an Imposthumation
in some part of the Body or other.</p>

<p>Now to account for such remarkable Alterations,
in such Subjects, we are obliged
to take notice, that here is the Suppression of
the Evacuation of a Humour, that had been
constantly discharged for a long time; and
this, we have before observed, will cause a
greater Fulness and Distention of all the Vessels.
Now the Quantity of the Blood being
very much encreased by the Addition of
this viscid Juice, the Celerity of its Motion
must be considerably abated, upon which
Account it will enlarge the Diameters of the
Vessels, by relaxing their Coats, and pass
with so great a Difficulty through the Capillary
Vessels, that if it arrive at any Part
where the Fibres have lost their due Tensity
and Spring, it is disposed to stagnate, and
produce an Imposthumation. If this does
not happen, as the Motion of the Blood
continues to be very languid, the Quantity
of Spirits filtrated in the Brain will be less
upon two Accounts: <i>First</i>, Because as the
Blood moves more slowly, all the Parts of
the Body through which it circulates, will
receive a much less Quantity of it in a given
Time, than they must have done, had it
moved with a greater Celerity. <i>Secondly</i>,
The Viscidity of the Blood, together with
it’s Motion diminished will lessen the Quantity
of Spirits, according to the 20th and 22d
of Dr <i>Wainright</i>’s Propositions of Animal
Secretion.</p>

<p>Now this being so, it is no wonder to observe
such an Inactivity of the Parts, Sleepiness,
weak Digestion, <i>&amp;c.</i> to attend a Person
under such Circumstances: For the
Quantity of Spirits being so much diminished,
the Parts can never be sufficiently
influenced by them to perform their respective
Functions with that Force as usual. To
this we may add, that they are in a great
measure deprived of their Power and Spring,
and Sensation in general is not near so strong
and lively. From hence it is evident, that
when Nature has found a Passage whereby
she may disburden herself of any excrementitious
Humours, we ought for a considerable
time to give proper Internals, and make
use of some other Method, as by Issues, or
such like, whereby we may divert the
Course of the Matter, which, if I may so
say, has been so long together determined
to pass the same way. Beside this Advantage
which will accrue by that Method, there may
be near the same Quantity of Humours evacuated;
and so those unhappy Accidents,
will be prevented, and the Ulcer cured.</p>

<p>I am perswaded, that it is not without a
great deal of Difficulty that we can sometimes
divert the Tendency of Humours to a
Part; and I can bring several Instances of
Sores that have been healed, where the suppressed
Matter has discovered it self, by an
Aposthume near the Place where the Sore
was, a short time after it had been healed.</p>

<p><i>Fælix Wurtz</i>, who was a very judicious
Surgeon, informs us, That it sometimes
happens, that in a little time after a Patient
has been cured of a Wound of the
Head, he feels violent Pains there, which
indicates that Matter is collected in the
Part. He adds, That many die of it, by
reason the Cause is not understood by some
Surgeons. This Remark proves, that the
Wounds were not kept open long enough,
or else that the Surgeon acted imprudently
in not making use of proper Means to divert
the Tendency of the Humours to that Part;
not but it will abundantly more easily happen
to those Parts that are depending, and
where the Weight of the viscid Fluid will
incline it to settle.</p>

<p>I knew a lusty Fellow, about twenty five
Years of Age, that had an Ulcer on the internal
Ancle of his left Leg near twelve
Years: It had been cured three or four
times, but he always found himself very
much indisposed after it, till it broke out
again, and the Matter had a free Discharge:
At length, upon his coming from Sea, it was
healed again, upon which he was seized
with a violent Pain in his Head, Loss of
Appetite, which the next Day was succeeded
by a violent Fever and Looseness. His
Physician ordered, among other Things, a
large Blister-Plaister, to be applyed to the
Leg on which the Ulcer had been. The
Patient recovered; but what was very observable,
was, that the Sore the Blister-Plaister
had made terminated in an ugly Ulcer,
which would not heal, though various Applications
were made use of. If Nature had
been in this Case compelled, as it were, and
forced to a Compliance in the healing of this
Ulcer, it is probable the Matter would have
been thrown upon another Part, and so occasioned
a Disease there.</p>

<p>By this we may see how cautious we
ought to be not to proceed in a Method contrary
to the Dictates of Nature; for if we
do, we consequently disturb her regular
Motions, upon which she oftentimes commences
a new Work, which, if it does not
tend to the Subversion of the whole Oeconomy,
there ensues a Permutation of the
Disease, by the Translation of the Matter
from one Part to another.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to recount all the
obscure Motions Nature makes use of to
accomplish such Ends: We will only mention
some where the Disease has been perfectly
changed from what it was before by
such Methods. <i>Mear</i> gives us an Instance
of a Dropsie of the Breast, which succeeded
an ill-cured Hydrocele. <i>Hildanus</i> observes,
that an inveterate Ulcer of the left
Leg being unhappily healed up, the Patient
died of a Pleurisy some Months after.</p>

<p>To this I may add an Observation of a
Man that had an old Ulcer on each Leg,
which being attempted to be cured, as the
Matter gradually lessened, he was deprived
of his Sight. There was no Alteration to
be observed in the Eyes of this Person, but
only a Dilatation of the Pupils, as is generally
observed in a <i>Gutta Serena</i>, which was
judged to be his Case. In short, upon the
running of the Sores, though he had been
perfectly blind, he effectually recovered his
Sight again.</p>

<p>I will not tire you, <i>Sir</i>, with the Recital
of any more Cases of this Nature. What
has been hitherto said, I hope is sufficient to
incline you to believe, that the immediate
Cause of the Death of the Child I spoke of
in the former part of the Letter was the
Suppression of the Matter, which had continued
to discharge in such large Quantities
so long together. And that such a sudden
Stoppage of a Discharge of Matter may procure
a Patient’s Death, though the Symptoms
that proceed may be different. I have
likewise shewn the Difficulty there is in Diverting
the Tendency of the Matter to a
Part, and mentioned how one Disease is
sometimes converted into another: But of
what Use these Remarks may be I leave
you to judge. To me it seems reasonable
enough to suppose, that as a regular Method
of Practice is not the Effect of a Man’s Sagacity,
but the Product of repeated Experiences,
every thing that occurs may tend, by
a proper Application, to the Illustration of
the Art. What else has made some Men so
famous for their Prognosticks? Had not our
great Master <i>Hippocrates</i> a Respect to the
Suppression of the Discharge of Matter
from Ulcers, when he expressed himself
thus, <i>Ulcus lividum &amp; siccum, aut cum
virore pallidum lethale est?</i> And this we
have known to be true in several Cases.</p>

<p>Well then, does not this sufficiently
prove, that where we have Cause to fear a
Suppression of the Discharge, we ought to
remove any Impediment that may embarass
Nature in her Work, and advise a proper
Method to promote the precipitating the
morbific Matter? For so shall we, by joining
our Forces with those of Nature, still
keep her in due Course; and that when she
is grown languid, and departing from her
former Measures.</p>

<p>You must excuse me, if I digress a little
to take notice of an Observation that some
Authors have made, <i>viz.</i> That from a dangerous
Fracture of the Skull, after Death
the Liver has been often found impostumated.
They have been likewise very sollicitous
to know which way the Matter could
be conveyed to so remote a <i>Viscus</i>; but it
would be needless for me to offer what has
been said in this Case, because it seems to
be evident enough, that a Part of it is reassumed
by the Vessels; which, with that
should have been discharged from the Mass
of Blood, is by the Circulation deposited in
that Part. But here we may start a considerable
Problem, which is, How comes it
to pass that the Morbific Matter if it’s Discharge
is suppressed, is thrown upon the
Liver rather than any other Part? In order
to the Solution of this, we ought to consider,
That the Spleen is subservient to the Liver
in performing its Office, by giving the Blood
a Check in it’s Progress, whereby it’s Velocity
is lessened; otherwise so thick a Juice as
the Bile could not be separated from it. Now
the Motion of the Blood being rendered
abundantly slower in this Part, it is no wonder
that the Morbific Particles separate themselves
from it, while the Filtration is carrying
on, and by their Assemblage form an
Abscess in the Part.</p>

<p>You may perhaps expect, <i>Sir</i>, that I
should make an Apology to excuse the
Length of my Letter; but I assure you, the
Pleasure I have taken in writing it would
oblige me to make it of a larger Extent, if
I did not find I should be forced to take notice
of some things, which may perhaps
have a Place elsewhere. I have only this to
add, that if through the little time I have
taken to write it in, I have in any part
omitted to pay that Respect as is due to you,
I shall very readily ask your Pardon. In

the violent Pressure upon the
Brain, by the depressed Pieces of the fractured
Skull; yet the little Patient laboured
under no worse Symptom, than a Head-ach,
and was in a Condition to walk about the
Chamber. This was really very remarkable;
but if you will be pleased to give your self
the Trouble of reading the following Account,
I do not question but you will meet
with something much more surprizing.</p>

<p>On <i>November</i> the 4th, 1707, it happened,
that during an Engagement between
a small <i>English</i> Vessel and a <i>French</i> Privateer,
near <i>Margate</i>, one of our Men was
unfortunately wounded by a <i>Bullet</i>, which
past through the middle of the <i>Os Frontis</i>.
The Surgeon aboard the Ship immediately
enlarged the Wound, by making an Incision
through the Integuments, but could
not discover the Bullet; whereupon he dressed
him up, and the same Day being set
ashore, he was dispatched for <i>London</i>. On
<i>Thursday</i> the 6th Day of the same Month,
he arrived, having walked much the greater
part of the way in that time, which is about
66 Miles; the same Day his Surgeon endeavoured
to extract some Pieces of the
Bone, which discovered themselves through
that Aperture which was made by the Bullet,
but without Success; for they consisted
chiefly of the internal Table, which were
much larger than the Hole in the external:
Upon this the Wound was immediately
drest up, and a second Attempt was made a
Day or two after; but it proved as successless
as the former. In the mean time, the
Patient continued to be very hearty and
well, and seemed to be no more indisposed
than if he had only received a slight Wound
of the Head. The opening the Skull with
the Trepan was proposed, and which would
probably have been put in Practice in a Day
or two’s time: But on the Sabbath-Day
Morning following, after he had rested well
all Night, he was seized with such violent
convulsive Motions as were very surprizing;
during which he expired. The Body being
laid on a Table to be dissected, all it’s Parts
appeared so prodigiously inflated, that the
Person, when a live, being one of the largest
Stature, it seemed perfectly monstrous. A
Puncture being made in any Part through
the Integuments, there was nothing discharged
but a subtile Matter or Air; immediately
after which the Part subsided,
though before on a Compressure of the Fingers
it would receive such an Impression as
is observed in Oedematous Tumours; but
it would suddenly return to it’s former State.
The Surface of several of the Parts appeared
livid and vesicated. The Skull being
opened, the Bullet dropped out of the Brain,
all the Fore-part of which was corrupted,
and abounded with a thick yellowish Juice,
of a very offensive Smell; there were two
or three very large Pieces of the inner Table
of the Skull, with some smaller that were
found among the lacerated Membranes, and
lodged in the corrupted Brain.</p>

<p>This Case is so particular, that it may not
be amiss if we make some Reflections on
it.</p>

<p>We are very well assured, <i>Sir</i>, that it
has been a Matter of very great Surprize to
several ingenious Men, to consider how the
various Operations of the Body have continued
to be performed, when those Parts
which were so absolutely necessary to the
Well-being of the Animal, have been naturally
or accidentally disordered to such a degree,
as to suffer a perfect Confusion of their
Parts: And of this we find Variety of Instances
in those Authors, who have very
obligingly applied themselves to relate the
Histories of deceased morbid Bodies. But
that the Brain it self, which is the very
Source and Principle of all Animal Functions,
should, after it has undergone such a Violation
as we have observed, continue several
Days without incommoding the Person in
the least respect, is really very remarkable;
for if we do but consider what an absolute
Necessity there is for a constant Supply of
Animal Spirits, to empower the Parts to
perform their mechanical Actions, and at
the same time reflect on the Disorder and
Corruption of that Part, whose Office it was
to secrete a sufficient Quantity of those
Spirits, we might very reasonably expect a
considerable Alteration in the whole Body.
One might very well think, that from the
Deficiency of Spirits that would ensue, the
Parts could no longer continue to perform
their Actions, but must gradually lose their
Power and Spring, and at length become in
a manner destitute of Motion: For we can
scarce perswade our selves, that Nature in
this Case is so provident as to suffer the
<i>Cerebellum</i> and <i>Medulla Spinalis</i> to filtrate
the Spirits in a greater Quantity, that
they might supply the Exigencies of the
Body.</p>

<p>There still remains some considerable <i>Phænomena</i>
to be accounted for, as the convulsive
Motions, the prodigious Inflation of the
Body, <i>&amp;c.</i> As to the former, it may be
perhaps accountable from the violent Conflict
we may imagine to have happened on
the mutual Engagement of the Juice that
was found so plentiful in the corrupted
Brain, and that which had undergone no
Alteration from it’s original Purity. Add to
this, that the Animal Spirits in the Nerves
receiving some ill Impressions by the Accession
of some of those impure Particles,
could no longer sally out upon the Command
of the Will to any particular Part, but must
consequently so irritate the Nerves, as to
cause their Extremities to contract themselves;
upon which Account the Blood becomes
imprisoned in the muscular Fibres,
which abridging their Length by enlarging
their Diameters, the Parts must necessarily
suffer involuntary Contractions: At the same
time those minute Capillary Extremities,
which terminated in the Miliary Glands,
were probably so contracted, or crispt up,
as perfectly to close the Orifices of the excretory
Ducts of those Glands, which are
the only sudatory Pores: By this means all
that vast Quantity of Matter which is usually
discharged by insensible Transpiration, became
imprisoned underneath the Integuments
of the Body, and so distended all its
Parts to such a prodigious Degree, as was
observed. This Constipation of the excretory
Ducts, and crisping up of the Extremities
of the Nerves, might likewise have a
considerable Effect on the small Branches of
the Arteries and Veins which accompanied
them; for by this means the Blood they
contained might be obliged to stagnate in
the Glands, which must occasion an Enlargement
of the Diameters of those minute
Vessels; and so the livid Colour which
was extended on several Parts might be probably
procured: Besides this, the Blood being
in such a comprest State, some of its
more fluid Parts might be exprest from it,
which lodging underneath the <i>Cuticula</i>,
might make the Parts appear to be vesicated;
there is nothing more certain, than
that Animal Bodies perspire after Death; or
that the perspirable Matter continues to pass
off as long as the Body retains any Warmth.
This is confirmed by an Experiment of Sir
<i>Thomas Browne</i>, in his <i>Pseudodoxica Epidemica</i>,
where he tells us, That “upon exactly
weighing and strangling a Chicken in
the Scales, upon an immediate Ponderation
he could discover no sensible Difference
in Weight; but suffering it to lie 8
or 10 Hours, till it grew perfectly cold,
it weighed most sensibly lighter. The
like, says our Author, we attempted and
verified in Mice, and performed their
Trials in Scales that would turn upon the
8th or 10th part of a Grain.”</p>

<p class="ml1em"><em class="gesperrt"><i>SIR</i></em>,</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">I LOOK</em> upon it as a peculiar Happiness,
to live in an Age when Men of our
Profession consider, that as the Art is
capable of receiving daily Improvements;
useful Discoveries, confirmed by Experiments,
ought to receive the joint Concurrence of their
good Wishes; notwithstanding, they may
contradict an Opinion that has been almost
universally received. These we shall always
find, are the Gentlemen who in opposition
to those Bigots whose Tempers discover them
to be the Votaries of a few opinionative Men,
endeavour to guide their Judgments by Reason,
backed with judicious Observations, and
whatever Arguments are produced, will
never go about to controul Matters of Fact.
It is a grand Truth that Necessity gave Being
to <i>Physick</i> and <i>Surgery</i>, and Experience is the
only Way to bring them to Perfection; but
it is much to be lamented by them that are
Well-Wishers to those Arts that the Persons
which are perhaps capable of advancing
them most, devote themselves so much to
speculative Fictions (the Effects of teeming
Brains) that some have pretended with a magisterial
Air to dictate, even to Experience itself.
In such a Case it would be needless to
go about to offer Arguments sufficient to disengage
their Inclinations, Time only must
discover to them their Error, when it makes
them sensible they have, to no Purpose, persisted
in the Pursuit of frivolous Niceties;
for in reality, the Benefit of Mankind in
general is deduced from Practical Truths.
The Thoughts of this are sufficient to inspire
every generous Soul with an ardent Desire
of discovering something that may be of so
universal an Advantage: As for my own
Part, I was not animated to concern my self
in the Undertaking I have engaged in, by a
Prospect of gaining that Honour that is often
liberally bestowed on those that mint new
<i>Hypotheses</i>, or make new Discoveries; my
only Design was to inform my self, whether
some of those Diseases, which are generally
reputed incureable, are not actually in themselves
curable, and by this means to wipe off
a Reproach which has been cast on Nature,
when in reality it proceeds only from our
own Weakness, and the Infirmity of our
Art. A diligent Application to those Distempers
which baffle us most, has been frequently
recommended by very reputable Authors,
and some of those who have obliged
us with the Histories of <i>Diseased Persons</i>,
have very often mentioned considerable Cures,
which have been happily performed after the
Patients have been looked upon by some as incurable.
<i>Hippocrates</i> tells us, <i>Lib.</i> 2 <i>Aph.</i>
52. <i>Si Medico secundum rectam Rationem
Facienti, Curatio non statim succedat, non est
tamen mutanda Methodus, quamdiu id restat
quod à Principio visum est.</i> I am fully persuaded
that most Practitioners in <i>Surgery</i>
have at some Time or other, by an industrious
Application, been successfull where
Art could not warrant a Cure. As to the
<i>Disease</i> I propose to make the chief Subject
of this Letter, tho’ it be generally branded
with the Character of Incurable, I must
freely own I never could discover any thing
essential to it in general that should make it
so; it is true, there are many <i>Diseases</i> that
are not to be cured, where certain Circumstances
are conjoined, which very much contribute
to the Misfortune; tho’ Others of
the same <i>Class</i> exempt from those Adherents
may, perhaps, be happily enough cured;
Thus for Instance. In <i>Cancers</i> we have but
little Reason to expect a Cure in a Person
that is old, if the <i>Cancer</i> has been of many
Years standing, and is firmly fixed to the
Ribs; but if the Patient be not so far advanced
in Years as to be uncapable of receiving
the Benefit of Nature by the regular
Discharge of the <i>Menses</i> and the <i>Cancer</i> be loose;
notwithstanding, it be Ulcerated, over-spread
with fungous Flesh, discharge a filthy Matter,
and smell very offensively; we do upon
Experience affirm that such a Patient may
be cured. We must own we cannot be of
the Opinion of the <i>Paracelsians</i>, who affirm
there is no <i>Disease</i> but what is curable in any
Patient, for the Reason we have given; nor
can we with the <i>Galenists</i>, agree that the
<i>Gout</i>, <i>Dead-palsie</i>, <i>Stone</i>, <i>Cancer</i>, &amp;c. are
<i>Diseases</i> absolutely incurable; because Experience
discovers the contrary. We find
that Mr <i>Boyle</i> is of the same Opinion, and
thinks it were no ill Piece of Service to Mankind,
if a severe Collection were made of
the Cures of such Persons as have been judged
irrecoverable by the <i>Doctors</i>; that Men might
no longer excuse their own Ignorance by the
Impotency of Nature, and bare the World in
Hand, as if the Art of <i>Physick</i> and their Skill,
were of the same Extent. There seems to
be one very effectual Way to rescue the medicinal
Art from the Aspersions of some bold
Persons; and that is that of a certain Number
of regular Practitioners in <i>Physick</i> and <i>Surgery</i>,
each of them should apply himself to the
Study of one particular <i>Disease</i>: By this means
we should soon find they would be capable
of surmounting those Difficulties that have
all along baffled the most Judicious of the
general Practicers. How odd, and disagreeable
this Opinion may seem to some Men I
know not; but I assure you, <i>Sir</i>, I find it of
a very ancient Date; for <i>Herodotus</i>, a <i>Greek
Historian</i> informs us, that before his Time,
the <i>Physicians</i> in <i>Egypt</i> used to apply themselves
to the Study and Advancement of one
<i>Disease</i> in particular. <i>Baricellus</i>, and <i>Lionardo
di Capoa</i>, observe the same likewise, in
Relation to the Practice of <i>Physick</i> in that
Country. <i>Baglivi</i>, in the Scheme he lays
down for erecting of Colleges for the Improvement
of <i>Physick</i>, tells us, that every Fellow
of his Literate Society must have one <i>Disease</i>
allotted him for the Task of his whole Life;
and which elsewhere he says is not sufficient
for the illustrating the Province of one <i>Disease</i>;
but that we lie under a Necessity of
taking in Materials from all Hands. But there
is no Man that we know of, has spoke more
agreeably of this Matter than Dr <i>Harris</i>,
in his <i>Pharmacologia Anti-Empirica</i>, he
owns that he took more than ordinary Pains
in one particular <i>Disease</i>, and assures us he
verily believes if learned Men, after a compleat
Acquisition of the universal Method of
<i>Physick</i>, and a necessary Search into the Nature
and Cures of those manifold Infirmities
and Diseases, which, with a kind of infinite
Variety, do afflict Mankind, would, with
their utmost Vigour and Resolution, prosecute
the Knowledge of some one <i>Disease</i>
eminently above others; they would, most
certainly, find a particular Providence attending
and assisting them in so good and
honest a Design. He adds, a few Pages farther,
that wherever a Man’s Thoughts are
intent and fixed, wherever his Genius does
naturally incline, and all his Aims and Application
do continually tend, whether it be
to pertinent or insignificant Matters;
whether it be to useful, or else meerly curious
Things; if he has but tolerable Parts,
and Education corresponding, he can hardly
ever miss; it is hardly possible he should miss
the becoming Eminent, and in great Measure
perfect, (I mean perfect (says he) according
to the Modulum of Human Capacity)
in that one Point. But there is one
Thing to be recommended to the Consideration
of the Person, who takes upon him
the Enquiry into the Nature of one particular
<i>Disease</i>, which perhaps he might be very
liable to err in, if not cautioned against;
and that is, that he be not too bold and rash
in his Attempts; for, as <i>Galen</i> says, <i>The</i> Physician’s
<i>Art is not like that of an</i> Artificer, <i>who
may make what Experiments he pleases, to satisfy
his Curiosity; because if he spoils the Materials
he works on, no Body is endangered by
the Miscarriage: In Corpore autem humane</i>
(adds he) <i>ea tentare quæ non sunt Experientium
comprobata Periculo non vacat, cum temerariæ
Experientiæ Finis sit totius Animantis internecio</i>.
I believe we shall find that one of the
grand Reasons, why Persons, generally
speaking, have been so negligent in making
any Attempts on <i>Cancers</i>, has been the seeming
Discouragement they have all along met with
from Authors. The Caution <i>Hypocrates</i> has
given us in his Thirty eighth <i>Aphor. Sect.</i> 6.
has scarce been omitted by any one considerable
Person that has wrote of this Subject, tho’
perhaps the Sentence has often had an Exposition
put upon it, contrary to the Author’s
Meaning; but of this, more in it’s proper
Place. I proceed now to give an Idea of <i>Cancers</i>
in the Breast from an external Cause;
and this I shall do without concerning my
self with the Opinion of the Ancients; for
since we have been so happy as to live in an
Age which will be remarkable for the many
surprising Discoveries which have been made
in <i>Anatomy</i>: We should be reckoned unworthy
the Advantages we enjoy, if we did not
study to apply them to the Benefit of Mankind
in general. The more inquisitive and
learned Part of the World, are at this time
very well assured that the Animal Body is an
exquisitely framed Machine, and that it’s
Composure is little else than a Compages of
branching and winding Canals, which are
kept to a moderate Degree of Extention,
by Fluids of different Natures; and that the
Motions of these were first determined by the
divine Architect: Thus in a natural State,
the whole <i>Fabrick</i> is governed by certain Laws
impressed on the Fluids; and we often find
the unhappy Consequences of the Discomposure
of a Part, to discover themselves first
by an Interruption of the Motion of the animal
Juices. Thus in a <i>Cancer</i> of the Breast
which proceeds from a Blow or Bruise (as
upon strict Enquiry we have found they most
commonly do) is it not probable that by such
means a Confusion of the true Order of the
little Glandulous Grains and their excretory
Ducts may happen? and at the same time an
extravasated <i>Lympha</i> may lodge in such a spungy
Texture, which in time becoming viscid,
will coalesce with the Glandular Substance,
and form a <i>Mass</i> considerably compact? Now
this being so, it is reasonable to believe that as the
Lymphatic Juice continues its Motion till it
arrives at the indurated Part, its Passage must
be embarrassed there; upon which, it will soon
be qualified for an Union with the remaining
Part of the glandulous Substance of the
Breast; and so the whole be perfectly changed
from what it was before. This <i>Hypothesis</i>
is in a great Measure grounded on Experiments;
for if we express a Juice from some
of the <i>Cancerous Mass</i>, and hold some of it
in a Spoon over a Fire, there immediately
flys off a small Vapour, and the Remainder
hardens not unlike the white of an Egg boiled;
this shows it to have the Properties of the
<i>Lympha</i>; for the Chymical <i>Analysis</i> of that
Liquor assures us it is a Composition of a great
deal of fixt <i>Sulphur</i>, a little <i>Volatile</i>, some
<i>Phlegm</i>, and much <i>Volatile Alkalie</i>; to which
some add a little Earth: Now while the <i>Volatile
Alkalie</i> keeps the Sulphur dissolved, the
<i>Lympha</i> remains in a State of Fluidity; but
when, by making the same Experiment, the
<i>Volatile Alkalie</i> is evaporated, the Remainder
hardens, and forms a pretty compact,
whitish Substance. From hence the judicious
<em class="gesperrt"><i>SURGEON</i></em> may easily deduce
the Reason why these Sort of Tumours can
never be brought to Suppuration. We shall not
be so particular as to mention those <i>Cancers</i>
which proceed from internal Causes, nor several
other things which relate to the former;
for what we have here said, we look upon
to be commonly the Method of the Formation
of them; and as such, we did endeavour
to calculate Remedies that should peculiarly
operate on the <i>Mass</i>, so as to dis-unite the
firm Cohæsion of its Parts, and dispose them
to separate and come away, without any
great Inconvenience to the Patient; which is
what we would <i>recommend</i> with all the Earnestness
imaginable to those that are desirous
of discovering a Method of curing <i>Cancers</i>.
We were before sensible that it was possible
for one Body to operate on another determinate
Body, without being able to have any
such Effect on innumerable Others; as <i>Quicksilver</i>
will desolve Gold, <i>Aqua-fortis</i> Iron,
<i>Vinegar</i> the Shell of an Egg, <i>Oyl</i> common
Sulphur, <i>&amp;c.</i> which will not have any such Effect
on several other Bodies; for there is nothing
more certain than that the Operations
of Dissolvents are so determined by the various
Texture of the Bodies on which they are
employed, that a Liquor that is capable to
corrode a more hard and solid Body, may be
unable to disunite the Parts of one more soft
and thin, if of a Texture indisposed to admit
the small Parts of the <i>Menstruum</i>. It may be
expected I should say something in relation
to that which is generally looked upon to be the
grand Cause of the Incurableness of <i>Cancers</i>,
I mean the acid Humour in the Blood. But
if those Gentlemen who are fond of entertaining
this Opinion, do but consider that
<i>Cancers</i> are often formed in a perfect State of
Health; and that during the Time the Cancerous
Substance dissolves, and comes away
according to our Method, the Sides will run
a digested Matter, and heal by the Application
of dry Lint only; they will be of my
Opinion, that neither the <i>Atrabile</i> of the
Ancients, the corrosive <i>Alkalious</i> Salt of the
<i>Chymists</i>, nor the predominant <i>Acid</i> of the
Rest of the Moderns, are capable of procuring
those Alterations that <i>Cancers</i> are sometimes
attended with. If we trace the Writings
of our Predecessors to their earliest Date,
we shall find that many of them have made
Mention of the Roots of the <i>Cancer</i>, which
they took to be the large blew Veins that are
often extended on its Surface; and the entire
Removal of these they thought to be absolutely
necessary, or the Patient could not be
cured: But I believe there is no Body at this
Time that considers the <i>Mechanism</i> of the
Parts in such a Condition, but will agree
they are the necessary Consequents of it, and that
their Absence, or Presence is of no Importance;
that the <i>Cancer</i> is sometimes attended
with Adherents, or Appendices, which may
very well resemble Roots, we are assured;
but these generally lay deep, and not easily
discovered; the most considerable One that
ever we saw was very near Five Inches long,
and of an unequal Bigness, some Part of it
did not exceed the Largeness of a <i>Goose</i>’s
Quill, but some others were near as big as
the Top of the Thumb, which resembled so
many Knots in it, it divided in the Middle,
and continued separated about an Inch and a
Half, and then re-united, it was of a more
tender Substance than the Body of the <i>Cancerous
Mass</i>, but of the same Colour, and was
probably the Juice that was last applied to
the <i>Cancer</i>, which assumed a Form agreeable
to the Cavities it lodged it self in. Such Adherents
as these are, I am more inclined to
believe, are the Cause of the unsuccessful
Attempts on <i>Cancers</i>, than any <i>Acid</i> in the
Blood; for I am of opinion there are few
Persons unacquainted with Medicines that
are capable of correcting its <i>Acidity</i> when it
happens; and had the Cure of <i>Cancers</i> depended
on that, I am positive they would
not at this Time have had such ill Character.
We have before shewed that <i>Cancers</i> have
generally their Rise from a Blow or Bruise,
and that when the Body is in an healthful
Condition, and the Blood and <i>Lympha</i> temperate
and sweet: Now if there always is an
<i>Acidity</i> of the Blood when Persons are afflicted
with <i>Cancers</i>, the <i>Cancers</i> must sometimes
cause it, and not the <i>Acid</i> in the Blood
the <i>Cancers</i>, as is the Opinion of most of the
Moderns. What has been hitherto said, is
sufficient to prove that if Men will be always
so sluggish as to acquiesce in the Dictates and
Dogmatical Positions of their Predecessors,
and not exert their Faculties in endeavouring
to undeceive themselves; we must no longer
expect our Art will receive any Advancements,
but as Slaves to their Opinions content
our selves with what we know already.
Were not <i>Parisani</i>, <i>Riolan</i> the Son, and
<i>Plempius</i>, so much in the Interest of the Ancients,
that when our Country-man, the assiduous
<i>Harvey</i>, had discovered the Circulation
of the Blood, they not only opposed his
plain Demonstrations, but engaged in vigorous
Disputes against him, tho’ at the last they
were obliged shamefully to recant their Follies.
<i>Celsus</i> tells us, <i>Vix ulla perpetua Præcepta
Ars Medicinalis recipit</i>; scarce any
of the Precepts of the Medicinal Art are perpetual.
And shall we engage then in the
List with a few opinionative Men, that ground
their Course of Practice on those Methods
only, in which they have been brought up,
and implicitly assent to the Conjectures of
others. No certainly, this would be to strangle
Truth, and extinguish the Vigour of our
Wits with precarious Authorities. Consonant
to this, Dr <i>Paxton</i>, in his lately published
Treatise, tells us, <i>Thus Men, out of a trifling
Distrust of their own Parts, will not use
them; or out of Laziness of Temper, will not
employ them, chusing rather to be wise or learned,
by being adorned with Others Whimsies, than undergo
any Labour, Fatigue, or Trouble of being
really so</i>. I believe there are some Men
that would rather contradict their Senses than
deny the Authority of a darling Opinion:
Of this, we have a sufficient Proof in an
Instance, related by an <i>Italian</i> Author before-mentioned.
He tells us, <i>That a certain
Publick Reader long Time versed and grown
Old in the Books of</i> Aristotle <i>being one Day
present at a Dissection, and clearly seeing that
the</i> Vena Cava <i>takes its Rise from the Liver,
confessed with Astonishment what his Senses discovered
to him, but that he ought not therefore,
by crediting his Senses, to contradict his Master,
who constantly affirms all the Veins in
Man’s Body to have their Original from the
Heart; because, said he, it is much more easy
for our Senses to be sometimes deceived, than
the Great and Sovereign</i> Aristotle. I here
seriously confess, I have as much Veneration
for Antiquity as any Person whatsoever; but
it would be ridiculous, if, as One says, we
should so far forego our own Judgments
as always to follow the Foot-steps of Others,
and to be certain of nothing our selves: For
this would be to see with others Eyes, to hear
with others Ears, and to understand with
other Men’s Intellects; so that whenever we
make Quotations from the Ancients to
strengthen our Opinions, we ought to do it
judiciously, and fully consider, whether their
Notions of Things are consonant to the Experience
of these Times. To prove to you,
<i>Sir</i>, that I have not proceeded to apply my
self to the Cure of so formidable a Disease,
without a Precedent, I shall instance to you
that <i>Fuschius</i>, a learned <i>Italian Surgeon</i>, had
such a wonderful Reputation for it formerly,
that some Authors say he was distinguished
by a particular Title, which discovered his
Success. His Method I have made use of,
and tho’ by passing thro’ several Hands (the
Author being mentioned by few) it has been
stampt with wonderful Encomiums, I have
not hitherto found it deserves it, notwithstanding
I did not omit the most minute
Circumstance in preparing the Medicine, or
prosecuting the Directions; but in its proper
Place, I shall take particular Notice of this,
and several other Remedies, that have been
recommended by some Authors, as substantial
and extremely useful; for if in One or
Two Instances they have been crowned with
Success, by Degrees they are handed down as
infallible in all Diseases of the like Form.
To the former Account I may add, that
Monsieur <i>Alliot</i>, <i>Physician</i> to the Duke of
<i>Lorrain</i>, has applied himself to the Cure of
this Disease very successfully, as a <i>Schedule</i>
he published at <i>Paris</i> some Years ago informs
us; we are likewise assured by Mr <i>Boyle</i>
that Dr <i>Haberfield</i>, one of the Principal
<i>Physicians</i> of <i>Bohemia</i>, has had extraordinary
Success in the Cure of <i>Cancers</i>; and the Sieur
<i>Gendron</i>, Doctor of <i>Physick</i> in the University
of <i>Montpelier</i>, has done extreamly well
on that Head; the latter of these Gentlemen
I cannot mention, without making an
Apology for not Publishing our Annotations
on his Enquiries relating to <i>Cancers</i> which
was promised at the latter End of our Chirurgical
Remarks, Printed above a Year ago;
but I assure you, <i>Sir</i>, I was more inclined for
some Reasons to offer what is therein contained,
with several Observations made with
the greatest Exactness, and to which, perhaps
I may have an Opportunity of making
several Additions, in a particular Treatise,
so that the whole may conspire to finish a
compleat Account of this Disease. I had at
first a Design of enlarging considerably on this
Subject in this Letter by adding various
Things, but considering they might better
find a Place in what I just now mentioned,
and that you did not desire an exact History
of the Disease, I resolved to omit them. I
shall now proceed to give you some Instances
of the Success of our Method, as being what
you are most solicitous of, the Cases I shall
relate shall be each of them different from
the other, for I know you do not approve of
that pompous Method of some Persons, that
enumerate abundance of Instances of Cures
when perhaps there is no great Difference
in the Cases or the Method of treating them.</p>

<p>The most considerable Case that offered it
self during our first Enquiries into the Nature
of <i>Cancers</i>, was that of a Woman, who
about Four Years before received a Blow on
one of her Breasts, upon which it began to
swell, grow painful, and after some time
became all over livid, and of so prodigious a
Bigness and Weight, that she was obliged
to keep it suspended by a Napkin round her
Neck: But in regard our Method was not
put in Practice till by other Applications it
was become ulcerated, we shall speak of it
as such. The Patient, then, at this time
complained of a very violent Pain, which
extended it self to the Back and Shoulder, by
the Communication of the Nerves (for those
of the Breast come from the fifth Pair of the
Spine, and from a <i>Plexus</i> about the <i>Clavicels</i>.)
To remedy this, she had taken no
small Quantity of <i>Hypnotic</i> Medicines, which,
without Doubt, destroy the due Texture of
the Blood, and so become prejudicial to the
Patient, and disadvantagious to the <i>Surgeon</i>
that proposes a Cure. But because Persons
generally find some Relief by Opiates, as
they retard the determined Motion of the
Blood, straiten the Nerves, and check the
tumultuous and disorderly Influx of the Spirits;
so, probably, in these Cases, their Use
will be continued. Besides the acute Pain,
the <i>Cancer</i> was over-spread with fungous
Flesh, its lower Part extreamly hard, knotty,
blackish, and its Basis seemed inclinable
to fix; the Matter which was discharged
was thin, reddish, and stank abominably.
This was the Condition of this poor Woman,
when we first applied our grand Dissolvent;
the Pain she was attended with the first and
second Day after was inconsiderable, nor did
she complain of more afterwards, than would
have been procured by the most mild and
easy Remedy the Dispensatory affords. In
four Days Time we found a very evident Alteration
for the Better; for the Consistence
of the Matter was changed, and the Surface
of the <i>Cancerous Mass</i> became somewhat
soft, we continued the Use of the same
Medicine, and in a few Days more some
part of the <i>Cancer</i> came away with the
dressing. In short, in about six Weeks time,
the whole Substance was entirely gone, and
nothing remained to be done but to heal the
Ulcer, which was effected in about a Fortnight.
During the time she was under Cure
we gave her a proper internal Medicine, not
calculated to destroy the Acidity of the
Blood, but to dispose the whole <i>Cancerous
Mass</i>, with its Appendices to come away,
which might otherwise, as the Seeds of the
Disease, cause it to spring again: Thus was
this Patient, (after so great a Fatigue she
had undergone before she came to me) perfectly
cured, and has continued so to this
Time, without any manner of Inconvenience
as she lately told me, it being a long
time since she has been well.</p>

<p>A Gentlewoman near fifty Years of Age,
by some Accident received a Blow on her
left Breast, which in a few Days was succeeded
by a considerable Tumour, whereupon
she applyed herself to a <i>Surgeon</i>, who
immediately let her Blood, ordered her to
take the <i>Lap. Hibern.</i> in Posset-Drink, and
embrocated the Breast with <i>Ol. Succini</i>:
By the use of these Means the Swelling was
much abated, a small Hardness only remaining,
which did not exceed a small Wallnut
in Bigness; in this State, with very little
Pain, she continued above a Year; but being
persuaded to apply an <i>Emp. de Ran. cum
Mer.</i> to it, it encreased very apparently, was
extreamly painful, and in Seven Months time
became as big as a large Egg: After this
she made use of a Woman who was reputed
Famous for these Cases; but by One or
Two of her Applications the Tumour became
as big again as before: In short it continued
to encrease gradually from that time, till the
whole Breast, which was of a monstrous Bigness,
and which was judged not to weigh less
than Eight Pound, in time became entirely
<i>Cancerous</i>. It was at this time that I saw it
the Skin was very livid, looking sleek and
shining, and seemed ready to open, as being
scarce capable of longer containing such
a prodigious hard <i>Mass</i> as laid concealed under
it, and was in all Probability as big as
the Breasts of the <i>Ammonian</i> Women, of which
<i>Juvenal</i> thus speaks, <i>In Meroe, crasso majorem
Infante Mamillam</i>. She had been with
various experienced and reputable <i>Surgeons</i>
before, among which was One not long ago
deceased, who was justly looked upon as an
Ornament of his Profession; but not one
would willingly attempt a real Cure by cutting
it off, or any other Way: They only
prescribed some palliating Remedies to remove
the Pain and prevent its Breaking.
I was animated by my former Successes,
and prevailed with my self to undertake it,
not thinking I was at all blameable if my
Success in so extraordinary an Affair contradicted
the Prognosticks of so many worthy
Gentlemen; and though it did, I shall at
all times think my self obliged to pay a Deference
to them. I began the Cure by removing
the Integuments from the upper
Part of the Cancerous Substance, but did not
wait for a Separation of the Slough the Escarotick
made for fear of being incommoded
in my Procedure by a Fungus; For this
Reason I mixed some of our Dissolvent with
a digestive Ointment, by which Means I had
a Part of the <i>Cancerous Mass</i> came away with
it, without any Trouble to my Patient. I
continued this Method of Dressing several
Days longer, with very little Alteration; but
upon a Complaint of a Pain between the
Shoulders, I was obliged to change my Medicine,
and foment the <i>Cancer</i> with an Infusion
of some of those Herbs that contain
many <i>Volatile</i> attenuating and active Particles.
And here I cannot but remark, by the
by, that Applications to the pained Part
would have been of no Effect, as I have
many times observed, and particularly in a
Woman which had a Cancerated Breast, that
was violently afflicted with a Pain in her Arm
on the same Side, which would not be removed
by any of the Applications the Person
that had the Care of her made use of
the affected Arm. To this I might subjoin
a very pertinent Case from <i>Galen</i>; but I fear
I shall digress too far. The Pain of my Patient’s
Back being removed, I proceeded to
apply the Dissolvent, which so softened the
Superficies of the <i>Cancerous Mass</i> that in
Three or Four Days Time I could take off
above a Quarter of a Pound of it with the
Edge or Back of my Incision Knife, and my
Patient not so much as feel me, this I continued
to accustom my self to, because it would
have been more tedious to have waited for the
coming away of the <i>Cancerous Mass</i> of it self.
Sometimes I varied my Applications as I saw
Occasion, but, as my Patient confessed, I scarce
put her to any more Pain during the Time her
Breast was dissolving (abating for the Pain of
her Back) than there is in the dressing of an
Issue. The prodigious Bigness of the <i>Cancerous
Mass</i> made the Cure the more tedious, for it
was above Three Months before all of it was
entirely dissolved and gone; but this being at
length surprisingly and very happily effected
the <i>Cancerous Ulcer</i> (the last Part of the <i>Cancer</i>
that came away left) was incarned and
cicatrized by an Infusion of vulnerary Herbs,
to which was added a small Quantity of
Tincture of Myrrh: Thus was this Cure entirely
compleated and my Success in it confirmed
that <i>French</i> Proverb, which says, <i>It
is better to be condemned to die by the Doctor,
than by the Judge.</i> I did not make use of that
internal Medicine I mentioned in the former
Case, because here I found no pressing Necessity
for the Use of it, but some other proper
Physick was taken to dispose the Ulcer
to heal, as one would have done in any other
Case. Upon the whole of this Cure, I cannot
say whether I had more Trouble with
the <i>Cancer</i>, or in endeavouring to oblige my
Patient to a strict Observance of some of the
Non-Naturals she so often erred in. There
is nothing can create a greater Trouble to
the <i>Surgeon</i>, than to find Patients negligent
of their Healths, by not endeavouring to
prevent or regulate Miscarriages, nor taking
so much Care of themselves, as they expect
the <i>Surgeon</i> should take of them. The
Rules and Directions of <i>Physicians</i> and <i>Surgeons</i>,
given to their Patients, we have Reason
to believe were not so often violated formerly;
for in some Places they obliged themselves
very strictly to the Observance of them,
and some Historians give us an Account that
<i>Selucus</i> made a Law; that if any of the <i>Epizephyrian
Locrians</i> drank Wine, contrary to
the <i>Physician</i>’s Direction, though they escaped
the ill Consequents that might have attended
it, Death was their Punishment, because they
did contrary to what was prescribed them.</p>

<p>A Woman about Thirty Years of Age had
been for a considerable Time afflicted with
a hard painful Tumour under her Tongue,
for the Cure of which she had applied her
self to various Persons, but without Success.
When I saw her I found the Swelling to be
hard, painful, of a livid Appearance, and
incommoded her so much in speaking, that
she could not pronounce her Words articulately.
I was of the Opinion of some Gentlemen
that had seen it before me, <i>viz.</i> That
it was undoubtedly <i>Cancerous</i>, and as such I
proceeded to cure it; but I met with more
Difficulties in this Case than I at first expected,
for after I thought the <i>Cancerous Substance</i>
had been entirely dissolved, and I had
reduced the Ulcer to a very narrow Compass,
it began to swell again, and in a short Time
enlarged it self to almost the Bigness it was
at first: This put me upon a Necessity of
making an Incision into the Body of the Tumour,
that I might commodiously come at
the remaining Part, and so dispose some little
Dossels of Lint, armed with our Dissolvent,
that they might have their desired Effect,
and this in every Respect answered
what we proposed; so that we proceeded
immediately to incarn the Ulcer, which we
did by a Lotion prepared of an Infusion of
some vulnerary Herbs, and <i>Mel. Rosar</i>. Thus
was this Woman perfectly cured, and has
continued well about a Year.</p>

<p>Because I have always found greater Difficulty
in treating <i>Cancers</i> of the Mouth and Lips
than those of the Breast, I will here relate
an Instance of one upon the lower Lip that
proved extreamly troublesome. It sometimes
happens that one, or more, of those Glands
which are spread on the Inside of the Cheeks
and Lips, called <i>Buccales</i> and <i>Labiales</i>, receive
some Damage by a Bite or Blow; upon
which they generally tumefy very much, become
painful, and in Process of Time (if proper
Means are not made use of) may become
<i>Cancerous</i>. Such was the Case of a Woman about
Thirty Years of Age, who having had
a Blow on her lower Lip, neglected it till it
was considerably tumefied, grew very painful,
and became extreamly troublesome to her.
The Circumference of the Swelling when
I saw it, which was many Months after the
Blow was received, was very much inflamed,
and a small Quantity of <i>Icorous</i> Matter discharged
from several small Pustules, which
over-spread it; the Middle, which was the
Body of the <i>Cancer</i>, was hard, of a whitish
Colour, and moveable; it’s Sides being only
connected to the contiguous Parts by some
small Filaments that were detached from it.
The same Thing Doctor <i>Gendron</i> has discovered
in an ulcerated <i>Cancer</i> on the Forehead
of the Servant of a certain <i>Marquess</i>,
as he observes in his Third <i>Chapter</i> of the
Tract we have before mentioned. I began
with my Patient by applying cool and temperate
Remedies, till the Inflammation was
considerably abated; after this I applied our
Dissolvent, which operated so mildly that
my Patient was not sensible of near so much
Pain as before she was apprehensive of: In
short, the Body of the <i>Cancer</i> was removed
and a good digested Matter discharged from
the Sore. Now all the Difficulty was after
what Manner we should proceed to dispose
the little <i>Cancerous</i> Branches in the Skin to
come away, but this we effected after the
following Manner; the Consistent of the
Medicine we before applyed, was such as was
no way qualified for rooting out the Cancerous
Filaments, whereupon we were obliged
to procure it’s Dissolution in a proper Menstruum,
though it required a considerable
Time to do it; by this means, we soon found,
that what before was ineffectual was now
capable of effecting what we desired. This
being done, the Ulcer was incarned by a
Sarcotick Infusion (for I never use Ointments
in these Cases) and cicatrized by the common
drying Plaisters. It is to be observed, that
the Scar still continues hollow (it having been
healed near Two Years) and not like those
that are the Consequents of well ordered
simple Ulcers.</p>

<p>The following Observation contains an
Account of one that was cured of an incipient
<i>Cancer</i> in her Breast, by Internals. I
was the rather inclined to set down the whole
Process of this Cure, because by these, or
such like Medicines, Persons under the same
Circumstances may perhaps be cured, though
by some they may be thought incurable.
The Case is this; A Gentlewoman, Thirty
Years of Age, of a thin spare Habit of Body,
by some Accident received a Blow upon One
of her Breasts, which put her to an immediate
Pain, and that very acute; but it lessened
upon her being let Blood, and the Application
of a discutient Plaister: However, in a
few Days, some of the glandulous Grains of
the Breast became indurated, and in Process
of Time, by their Increase, they were rendered
painful. At this Time she sought out
for fresh Advice, and continued Two Months
under the Care of a Person she was recommended
to; but Things not succeeding according
to Expectation, she became a Patient
to Three or Four more. During this
Time the Lump continued to encrease but
slowly, and at the Expiration of Six Months
it appeared to be a very hard painful Tumour
in the Middle of the Breast, but no bigger
than a Hen-Egg; whereupon it was thought
proper to commence her Method of Cure by
exhibiting the following <i>Pills</i>. ℞ <i>Pill. Tartar.
Quercetan.</i> ʒß. <i>Calomel</i> gr. viii. <i>F. Pill.</i>
N<sup>o.</sup> 5. These were likewise continued twice
a Week during the whole Cure; after this,
was ordered the following Infusion, ℞ <i>Vin.
Rhenan.</i> ℔ii. <i>Milleped.</i> ℥ii. <i>Ocul. Canc.</i> ℥ß
<i>Croci.</i> ʒii. This was not to be taken alone,
but when it had stood Four and Twenty
Hours, three or four Spoons-full of it was to
be mixed with a Draught of the ensuing
Dietetick-Drink, and taken in the Morning,
and at Four of the Clock in the Afternoon.
℞ <i>Rad. Sarsaparill.</i> ℥ii. <i>Chinæ</i> ʒvi. <i>Fig.
Sassafr.</i> ℥i. <i>Corn. Cervi</i>, ℥<i>Sem. Correand.</i>
℥ß. <i>Sant. Rub.</i> ʒii. <i>Coq. in aq. Font. Congiis
4 per Horæ dimidium, deinde stent Clause
super Cineres Calidos per Horas</i> xii; <i>postea
ebulliant ad tertiæ Partis Consumptionem</i>.
By the Continuance of these Means about
two Months, and observing a regular Method
of living, the Cure of this Patient was
effected; though by some she had been looked
upon as incurable, unless she would submit
the cutting it out, which is not often attended
with Success.</p>

<p>Perhaps, <i>Sir</i>, here you may object, that
it is acting disengenuously, and not like a
Friend, to give you an Account of those Persons
only where I have succeeded. To this
I answer, that excepting one Woman, that
was emaciated almost to the last Degree by
the excessive Discharge of a fætid Icorous
Matter from her Breast, and an Abscess under
her Arm, and who was carried off by a
violent Loosness, I never had a Person miscarried
under my Care, where I proposed a
Cure. That poor Woman I suffered my
self to be persuaded to take care of, having
but little Prospect of effecting it, yet my
Endeavours succeeded so well, that had it
been in our Power to put a Stop to her
Loosness, I am of opinion she might have
been cured.</p>

<p>What has been hitherto said, I do not
question but is sufficient to satisfy you, that
this formidable <i>Disease</i> is not so rebellious,
but that it may be sometimes conquered by
Art; and I might here relate a Case I have
at this present Writing, wherein not only a
Part of the <i>Cancer</i> was fixed, but there were
hard <i>Cancerous</i> Knots extended to the Arm-pit;
and yet this seems to be almost well;
the Ulcer that remains, and which heals
daily, not being much broader than a Crown
Piece. But in regard the Patient is not entirely
cured, I shall reserve this Relation untill
another Opportunity; though I will embrace
the present to assure you that I am,</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">WE</em> cannot come to a certain Knowledge
of the Principles of the Juice
which is lodged in the Cancerous Substance,
although it enjoyed the very same Properties,
of that which is discharged from an ulcerated
<i>Cancer</i>, from the Account which Authors
have given of the latter; for they have differed
very much in determining the Nature
of the Salts, with which they suppose it
abounds. <i>Helmont</i>, <i>Van Horne</i>, and most
of those Gentlemen that were Chymically
inclined, were of Opinion they belonged to
the Alkaline Family, but a far greater Number
than those, have thought they are Acid.
<i>Riolan</i>, the Father, <span class="sidenote-r"><i>Vide</i> Rio­la­nus, <i>Cap.</i> 13. <i>Sect.</i> 2.</span> in his Chirurgical
Works, without giving his
Opinion what the constituent Parts
of the purulent Matter are, affirmed it to be
as strong as Poison, and that no Death could
be devised too cruel for such a One as should
give it to a Man. This brings to my Remembrance
a very unhappy Accident a
Gentleman informed me of that befel
Mr <i>Smith</i>, one of the <i>Surgeons</i> of St <i>Thomas</i>’s
<i>Hospital</i>, who being so curious as to taste
the Juice of a cancerated Breast presently
after it was extirpated, found himself very
strangely affected by it, in a very short Time;
he washed his Mouth with various Things,
but nothing could free him from that penetrating,
malignant, and nauseous Savour, he
was continually attended with; in short,
he became consumptive, and in a few Months
died a Martyr to the Art of <i>Surgery</i>. I confess
when I received this Account it did not a
little surprize me, because I had several times
had the Curiosity to do the very same Thing,
at the <i>Hospital</i> where that unfortunate Genman
made the Experiment. I never found
any remarkable Sharpness in it, though it
was always attended with a very unpleasant
Savour. I proceeded at first very cautiously
in making this Attempt; for I deluted some
Drops of the Juice in several Spoons-full of
fair Water, till at length, not finding any
Inconvenience from it, I came to the Juice
it self. We cannot imagine the Death of
that Gentleman before-mentioned, was procured
by the Action of any corrosive Salts,
whether <i>Acid</i> or <i>Alkaline</i>, which would have
caused a Corrosion of the Parts, but that it
is only accountable from the extraordinary
Stench and Malignity of the Matter, which
impressing its Virulency on the Animal Juices
must undoubtedly disturb their regular Motions,
and cause the utmost Confusion of the
whole Oeconomy. It must certainly be a
very tragical Scene, to observe how Nature,
by so inconsiderale Means, confounds and
insults, over the Animal System; but still
there is nothing we are more certain of, than
that her Method of Procedure is always consistent
to the Rules she acts by. Since the
writing of this, looking over a little Tract
which informs us of the Rarities in <i>New-England</i>,
I met with a Relation which discovers
to us the peculiar and odd Quality of
the Juice of a cancerated Breast, or Wolf,
as our Author calls it. He tells us that an
indulgent Husband, by sucking his Wife’s
sore Breast to draw out the Poison, lost all
his Teeth, but was attended by no other
Inconvenience. Now this does not prove that
so strange an Effect should succeed the sucking
the Ulcer, because of the Corrosiveness of
the Matter; for had it been so, such tender
Parts as the Gums, Lips, and Tongue,
could not have escaped so well as to have received
no Damage by it.</p>


<p class="tac fs140 mt2em"><em class="gesperrt">Problem II.</em></p>

<p class="tac fs120"><i>Whether</i> Cancers <i>are contagious, or not.</i></p>



<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">THERE</em> has been a very great Disagreement
in the Sentiments of our
Predecessors as to this Point;
but <i>Zacutas Lusitanus</i> proposes
to prove it by Reason and Experience.
His Reasons are, <i>First</i>,
because in an ulcerated <i>Cancer</i> there is a Cadaverous

<span class="sidenote-l">Vid. <i>Zacut. de Prax.</i>
Med. ad­mi­rand. <i>Lib.</i> 1. <i>Obs.</i> 15.</span>

Stench and Rottenness, which infects
the Neighbouring Parts with it’s Virulency.
<i>Secondly</i>, Because a <i>Cancer</i> is the
same <i>Disease</i> as an <i>Elephantiasis</i>, and <i>Leprosy</i>
of a particular Part. To this, <i>Sennertus</i> in
his Posthumous Works answers, that all corrupted
and fætid Substances are not contagious;
for in a <i>Gangrene</i> and <i>Sphacellus</i>,
there is the greatest Corruption and offensive
Smell, yet we do not find that a Person is
killed by it: He adds, though a <i>Cancer</i> has
some Similitude to an <i>Elephantiasis</i>, they are
different <i>Diseases</i>. <i>Lusitanus</i> deduces his
Experience from an Observation of a poor
Woman, that having an ulcerated <i>Cancer</i> in
her Breast, and lying with three Children,
they were affected after the same Manner by
the Contagion. He says that Two of them
died, but the Third, which was of a stronger

<span class="sidenote-r"><i>Vid</i> Sennert.
<i>Paralipom.
ad Part.</i> 1
<i>Cap.</i> 19.</span>

Constitution, had the <i>Cancer</i> cut
off by a <i>Surgeon</i> and was cured.
<i>Sennertus</i> is of Opinion that
these Children did not contract
the <i>Disease</i> by Contagion, but
that it was by Hereditary Succession. We
likewise find that <i>Cardan</i>, <i>Lib. de Venen.
Cap.</i> 12. is of Opinion that <i>Cancers</i> are not
contagious. However, we will not make
any particular Enquiry into these Authors
Reasons, when they so strenuously maintain
this Point; but only relate a remarkable
History, which will prove the contrary, if
the <i>Cancerous</i> Matter comes to an immediate
Contract with a soft and glandulous Part.
The Relation I had (some time ago) from a
Gentleman not long since deceased, who,
out of a pious Disposition, had devoted himself
for several Years last past, to be serviceable
to the greatest Objects of Charity. He
informed me that a Tradesman’s Wife in
<i>Nottingham</i>, being so unhappy as to labour
under a <i>Cancer</i> in one of her Breasts, her
Husband was of Opinion he could relieve her
by sucking it; accordingly he put this Method
in Practice, in hopes without doubt he
could effect a Cure, by drawing the <i>Cancerous</i>
Matter out of the Nipple; he continued
his Attempts for some Time, but found it
did not answer his Design; for though a
small Quantity of Matter was discharged

<span class="sidenote-l"><i>Vide</i> Galen.
<i>in</i> Aph. Hip.
Com. Lib. 6
Aph. 38.</span>

this way, the <i>Disease</i> still became worse,
and she terminated her Life soon after.
Two Months were scarce expired before the
Husband of the Deceased came up to <i>London</i>,
upon Account of a swelling he had
arose on the Inside of the upper Jaw; he
applied himself to some ingenious <i>Surgeons</i>
for Advice, who assured him he must undergo
the drawing of Several Teeth on that
Side of the Jaw which was affected, and
have the Swelling, and Part of the Jaw-Bone
(if necessary) cut away; he went away very
much disatisfyed with so harsh a Proposal,
and became a Patient to a Person, who undertook
to cure him with <i>Gargels</i>, and such
inconsiderable Remedies; however, by the
Use of these Things he was of Opinion he
became much better, and thought he should
be cured. Upon this he retired into the
Country to his Business, but in less than a
Month’s Time he was obliged to come up again,
and have the former Method put in
Practice. But the Event was according to
that Expression of <i>Galen</i>, <i>Quibus
item sunt Cancri in cavitate Corporis,
aut Palato, sede utero, si
secentur, aut urantur, ulcera cicatrice
induci non possunt</i>. For the
Sore could never be brought to cicatrize, but
the <i>Cancer</i> continu’d to spread, till it had extended
in self over most of the internal Parts
of the Mouth, and to the inner Part of the
Nose: In this unhappy Condition, he lived
some time, but at last became so frightful
an Object, and the Stench that continually
proceeded from the Parts was so offensive,
that he retired himself from the World,
and finished his miserable Life in a Garret.
Since the finishing the <i>Solution</i> to the foregoing
<i>Problem</i>, I met with a Surgeon (a Foreigner)
who giving me an Account of the
present State of the Practice of <i>Surgery</i> in
the Country where he lived, and relating
some considerable Cases which had happened
within his own Knowledge, in answer
to my Desire, among other things, told me,
without any particular Intimation from me,
he knew a very odd Accident, which happened
upon a Woman’s having an ulcerated
<i>Cancer</i> in her right Breast, which was, that
she being poor, for want of other Conveniences,
suffered two Children she had to lie
with her in that Condition; at length one
of them, a Girl about five Years old, began
to be afflicted with a small painful Tumour
in one of her Breasts, which encreasing
to near the Bigness of an Egg, became
Livid, and entirely <i>Cancerous</i>; the Mother
died some time after, and the Child did not
long survive her; but the other Child continued
well. Several Surgeons gave their
Sentiments of this Case; some thought it
to be an Hereditary Indisposition; but considering
the Mother had no Appearance of a
<i>Cancer</i> before or at the Birth of the Child,
I cannot but readily embrace the Opinion of
those Gentlemen, that were inclined to believe
that it was contracted by Contagion,
seeing the Position of the Child’s Body was
such in Bed, that that Part of it which was
affected was almost always disposed to rub
against the Dressings soaked in Matter, (for
I understand the Mother took but very little
Care to change them often.) Now it is not
at all probable, that the malignant <i>Effluvia</i>,
which continually pass off from the <i>Cancerous
Mass</i>, and the putrefied Matter, can
dispose a Person at any little Distance to be
affected with the like <i>Disease</i>, for then the
other Child would have became a Sufferer;
but it may happen in some extraordinary
Cases, where the corrupted Fluid has attained
an exalted Pitch of Malignity, to
communicate some of its more active Particles
to the Blood and Spirit; and so causing
a very great Disorder in their Motions produce
a violent Fever, and Confusion of the
whole Oeconomy, so as to occasion a Person’s
Death. But see a remarkable Case in
<i>Tulpius</i>, <i>Lib.</i> 4. <i>Obs.</i> 8. That there are
several cutaneous <i>Diseases</i> that may be propagated
by Contagion, if a Person lies with
another, is by all allowed of; and that the
lying with a Person that has a <i>Cancer</i> may be
attended by such a <i>Disease</i>, from the Proofs
we have brought, I suppose will be agreed
to be equally as certain. But this cannot
happen unless the matter be very malignant,
and be suffered, by the Negligence of
the Patient, to come to an immediate Contact,
with a Part of the Body of the other
Person; for then, without doubt, it may
contuminate the Fluids, and incline them to
assume a Viscidity, to which the <i>Effluvia</i>
will immediately adhere, because they are
best qualifyed for a Union with those Substances
that are viscous. To this we may
add, that in those Persons that are nearly
related, the Malignity may be more easily
communicable because of their Analogy to
each other; for consonant hereto, <i>Diemerbroeck</i>

<span class="sidenote-l">Vide <i>Diemer­broeck</i> de <i>Pest</i>. Page 58.</span>

says in his Treatise of <i>the Plague</i>, that
<i>Kindred more easily receive the Infection from
one another</i>. But see more in

where you have likewise some
curious Thoughts relating to
Contagion.</p>

ordered always, upon such an Occasion, Defensatives
to be applied to the contiguous
Parts, to prevent their being inflamed; but
for as much as they were sensible the actual
Cautery would procure an Eschar, they recommended
the Use of Digestives to separate
it; after which, they proposed to heal it as

<span class="sidenote-r">Vide <i>Arceus</i>, lib. 2.
Cap 3. de <i>Curand.
Vulnerib.</i></span>

a common Ulcer. The very next Advance
this Operation received, that we have met
with, was by that Accurate
Writer <i>Franciscus
Arceus</i>, who obliged the
World with an exact
and methodical Account of the whole Method
of Procedure in extirpating a <i>Cancer</i> in
the Breast; though this Author would only
venture on those that were not Ulcerated,
those that were he looked upon as incurable.
We do not find that this Method was recommended
to the World by any remarkable
Histories of Cures effected by it; whether
it proceeded from the Unsuccessfulness of the
Attempts, or its Disuse, we cannot determine.
<i>Fabritius Hildanus</i> likewise made a
considerable Step towards the Encouraging
the Performing this Operation; and he
assures us, he has more than once done it
with Success; he did not only influence his
Cotemporaries to revive an Operation, that
was, perhaps, almost grown out of Date,
by the Histories of some Cases he recites;
but obliged them with the Figure of a Pair
of Forceps, which in this Operation are
very convenient to engage the Breast, and
thereby prevent the Pain the Patients are
sometimes put to, by piercing the Breast
with Needles armed with Silk to suspend it.
There are several Ways of performing the
Operation, mentioned by later Practitioners,
but at this Time there are few that are
willing to be concerned in it. A very considerable
Author speaking of extirpating a
<i>Cancerous Breast</i>, advises us to take care we
do not cut the Pectoral Muscle in the Operation:
But we have seen a very remarkable
Case of this Nature, where a Part of that
Muscle was cut away, and the Cartilages of
the two of the Ribs laid bare, and the Patient
happened to be cured. Now if our Predecessors
had so great a Respect to the avoiding
the wounding of this Part, as to make
their Incisions too superficial, their Operations
must be in all Probability unsuccessful;
for we are very well assured by Experience,
that their actual Cauteries will have
no good Effect here, nor will they consume
the remaining Part of the <i>Cancerous Mass</i>.
We have elsewhere shewed, that this Substance
upon boiling becomes hard and friable;
and we will here take the Liberty to
give our Opinion of the Use of Cauteries in
this Case. The <i>Cancerous Substance</i> we take
to be nothing more than a Transformation
of the small glandulous Bodies, which form
the Breast, and a Lymphatick Juice, intimately
incorporated therewith, into a hard,
close, whitish, and (by common Medicines)
indissolvable <i>Mass</i>. In some Cases,
perhaps, it may receive some Addition from
some Juices, which may distil from the
contiguous Fibres. This being granted,
what Benefit, can we reasonably imagine,
will ensue on this painful Method? Will
not the Fire, by causing the more Fluid
Parts of the <i>Mass</i> to evaporate, actually dry
up, torrefy, and harden it; and so dispose
it for displaying a Train of mischievous Effects,
on the contiguous Parts? and all this
without any very apparent Decrease of it
too: Nay, the very reducing of it to such
a Consistence, which very much resembles a
Piece of burnt Horn, is sufficient to procure
a perpetual Pain, seeing Medicines can
hardly soften it, so as to reduce it to its first
State.</p>


<p class="tac fs140 mt2em"><em class="gesperrt">PROBLEM IV.</em></p>

<p class="tac fs120"><i>Whether</i> Salivation <i>will Cure a</i> Cancer.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">THE</em> extraordinary Success this Method
has been attended with, in some Cases
of the greatest Difficulty, has so far recommended
it to the World, that it is at this
Time become of so great Repute, that there
are few Persons but what will willingly embrace
it, if proposed to them, provided they
have found former Methods prove ineffectual.
We once knew a Person, who laboured
under an ulcerated <i>Cancer</i> in her
Breast, advised to it, and who had certainly
under-gone it, though contrary to the
Opinion of some Persons concerned, if in
three or four Days time she had not been
reduced to such a weak Condition, that it
put an End to the Controversy. That a
<i>Salivation</i> has cured the most malign and
spreading Ulcers, and those that have been
of several Years continuance, notwithstanding
their Edges have been high, inverted and
assumed the Consistence of a callous Body,
we have found by several Instances; but
that it should cure a <i>Cancerous Ulcer</i>, an
<i>Ulcer</i> which is chiefly seated in a transformed
animal Substance, and which has no
Correspondence with the contiguous Parts,
is what we cannot believe. One of the
principal Effects of <i>Mercury</i>, if prudently
given, is, that it attenuates the Juices, clears
the Canals, destroys the ill Quality of that
Fluid that has a Hand in causing any Obstruction,
and renders the Juices temperate
and sweet. By effecting this, it is, that it
cures so many different Diseases, which perhaps
have not so great a Diversity in their
Causes, but have different Appearances,
which depend upon the Variety of Parts,
where the Cause operates. From hence any
One may judge, that a Person who discovers
a certain Method of curing <i>Cancers</i> by Medicines
only, will find that it will not consist
in a Secret for purifying the Juices,
which can have no Effect on the <i>Cancerous
Mass</i>, so as to procure it’s Dissolution; and
without a Remedy for which his Method
will be always unsuccessful. <i>Mercklin</i>, in
his Treatise <i>de Transfus Sanguinis</i>, page 35,
tells us we have no Reason to believe we
may have Success from Transfusion in a
<i>Cancer</i>, nor indeed would Injections succeed
better; though, perhaps, by this Means,
it is possible so to alter the Fluids, that <i>Ulcers</i>,
not <i>Cancerous</i>, may be cured in a short
Time, as it once happened to a certain Person,
who being under Cure for an inveterate
Pox, had some <i>Rosin</i> of <i>Scammony</i> infused
in the Essence of <i>Guaiacum</i>, injected into
his Veins, which Vomited him excessively;
but his <i>Ulcers</i> were healed in three Days
Time. From what has been hitherto said,
it is evident, that a <i>Salivation</i> can never
cure a confirmed <i>Cancer</i>, because it is not
capable of procuring a Dissolution of that
hard Substance, which is the real <i>Cancer</i> it
self. The Glands we have observed, with
the extravasated <i>Lympha</i>, and its Vessels,
are perfectly changed to a different Substance
to what they were before, all which make a
<i>Mass</i> of such a Nature, that it will be impossible
to procure it’s Dissolution by any inward
Means. If the <i>Cancer</i> was nothing
more than a Coagulation of the Juices in
the Vessels, or other Canals, or Pipes, the
Cure might be much more easily effected,
but as the <i>Cancer</i> is conjoined with such
Circumstances as we have mentioned, we
may affirm the Cure will be altogether impossible
without the whole Substance with
it’s Appendices or Branches (which we have
found they often have) be taken away; or
a perfect Dissolution of all of it be procured
by some external Remedy, which is capable
of operating on it after such a peculiar
Manner, as to dissolve the <i>Cancerous Substance</i>,
without having any such Effect on
the contiguous Parts.</p>


<p class="tac fs140 mt2em"><em class="gesperrt">PROBLEM V.</em></p>

<p class="tac fs120"><i>Whether Cancers are Curable by Causticks.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">THE</em> Difficulty that those of our Predecessors
who had Courage enough
to attempt the Cure of <i>Cancers</i>, must unavoidably
meet with, obliged them to enter
upon several Methods of Practice, in order to
be capable of surmounting it; and there have
not been wanting for these several hundred
Years last past, some Gentlemen in the Republick
of Medicine that have proposed to
conquer this Rebellious Disease, by the use
of some particular Causticks, they have recommended.
It is foreign to my Design,
to give an Account of the Composition of
the several Remedies, they have been big
with the Expectation of Success from; I
shall only take notice of one or two not
very pompous Preparations, that by some
Persons I know, have been looked upon as
extraordinary as any that have been transmitted
to us. <i>Guido</i>, who I think I may
justly say is one of the best Authors of so
ancient a Date, has been very lavish of his
Encomiums on <i>Arsnick</i>, and after him
<i>Fallopius</i>, <i>Rodericus a Castro</i>, <i>Ossenius</i>, <i>Penotus</i>,
<i>Faber</i>, <i>Borellus</i>, and others, have recommended
it in some particular Preparations.
That of <i>Fuschius</i>, who is said to
have cured abundance of Persons of <i>Cancers</i>,
in <i>England</i>, <i>Germany</i>, and <i>Poland</i>, having
had the most said in it’s Commendation, required
our more particular Notice; <i>Hartman</i>
calls it <i>Pul Benedictus</i>, which whether
it deserves that Title, we will leave to the
Reader to judge, after we have faithfully recounted
the Effects of it. Its Preparation
is as follows: ℞ <i>Arsenici albi</i> ℥i <i>subtilissime
pulverisetur per dies 15 de die tertio in
tertium affundatur Aq. vitæ, ut cooperiat
pulverem, post triduum Aq. vitæ abjiciatur,
ac nova affundatur, ac misceantur. Rad
Dracunouli Major, mense julio vel Agu. collect
&amp; in taleolas scissæ ac in loco ventis perflatili
exsiccatæ</i> ℥ii. <i>Fuliginis Camini splendidi</i>
℥iii <i>redigantur omnia in subtilissimum pulverem
super lapidem marmoreum, &amp; servetur
in Vase bene clauso vitreo. Ante annum
vero ad usum non erit it a commodus</i>. This
Powder I applied to a <i>Cancerated</i> Breast of
a Woman, under thirty Years of Age, after
having made a Sore by applying one of
the milder <i>Causticks</i>; the first Night it was
made use of, it caused a great deal of pain,
and the next Day, the Breast appeared very
much tumefied and inflamed, a small quantity
of Gleet, having discharged on the
Bolster: in short for fifteen Days she was
not free from pain, she had a <i>Fever</i>, was attended
with frequent <i>Vomitings</i>, <i>Faintings</i>,
and several other Disorders. I could afford
her but very little Relief by Internals, or
the most cool and temperate Applications to
the Breast; nor was it in my Power to remove
the dressing, it adhered so fast to the
Sore. There was a Discharge of a bloody
ferous Juice for twelve Days in a moderate
quantity, after which the Matter thickened,
and it began to smell somewhat offensive,
at the end of fifteen Days the Dressing
dropped off, and with it came away about
two Ounces of the <i>cancerous Mass</i>. The
Reader may easily imagine that making so
small a Progress in such a time, and that at
the Expence of so much Pain, I could easily
prevail with my self to desist from the
Undertaking, for the second Application
would have been attended with the same
Inconveniencies as the first, which to any
Persons that entertains such a concern for
his Patients as he ought to do, must be very
fatiguing; in short, after this I made use
of that Remedy I had elsewhere mentioned,
and which from its Effect was properly
enough called a <i>Dissolvent</i>, with this by the
Blessing of God the <i>Cancerous</i> Substance was
consumed in about three Weeks, and a perfect
Cure compleated in not many Days
after, the Patient which I saw lately continuing
perfectly well, it being the first Case
that ever Providence directed me to the use
of the Remedy in. <i>Hildan</i> has an Observation
very pertinent to what we have
before related; he tells us, that the <i>Powder</i>
so much celebrated by <i>Penotus</i>, and which
is much the same with that just now mentioned,
being applied to a <i>Cancer</i>, was succeeded
by such ill Symptoms, that it killed
the Patient in a few Days. We are informed
in the communicated Observations of
<i>Riverius</i>, that a Foreigner extirpated a Cancer,
that had began to Ulcerate in the Breast
of a Woman of fifty Years of Age, by the
following Application: ℞ <i>Arsenici</i> ʒi. <i>Salis
Armoniaci</i> ℥ii. <i>Sublimat. crud.</i> ℥iiii. <i>Aq; Fortis</i>
℥i. <i>These were to be distill’d to Dryness, then
an equal Weight of distill’d Vinegar put
thereto, which was to be distilled again, till
the remaining Matter, became of the Consistance
of a Paste.</i> The Surgeon bathed the
<i>Cancer</i> with hot Wine, and rubbed it with
Cloths for some time to <i>irritate</i> it, then
he spread some of his Composition on a
Bolster six times less than the <i>Tumour</i>, and
applied it; in twenty four Hours time,
it made an <i>Escar</i> as large as the Swelling, so
that it wholly consumed the <i>Cancer</i>; after
the Separation of the <i>Escar</i> he incarned the
<i>Ulcer</i> and cicatrized it. It is very observable,
that he did not engage in this painful Process,
without immediately causing a Fever,
which was attended with a <i>Vomiting</i>, <i>Loosness</i>,
and much Provocation of <i>Urine</i>; which
Symptoms lasted two or three Days, for
Nature was disordered by the destructive
Quality of a venemous Remedy. <i>Paracelsus</i>,
<i>Faber</i>, and some others, make mention
of Arsnical Preparations, that procure but
little Pain in their Operation; I had a Design
of making a Trial of some of these
Remedies, had I not in my Enquiries met
with what was very satisfactory to me,
though after knowing what I have related,
I should have always cautiously avoided the
use of any Remedy, in which the <i>Arsnick</i>
had not undergone such a Preparation as I
should have approved of, because I am assured
it may procure very mischievious Symptoms,
though in Substance, it do not so
much as touch the Skin, witness the <i>Amulets</i>,
in which it has been the chief Ingredient,
and of which there have been such
direful Accidents related by <i>Crato</i>, <i>Massaria</i>,
and <i>Zacutus Lucitanus</i>. I do not think it
impossible, but that <i>Arsnick</i> may be prepared
after such a manner as may, by the addition
of some convenient Body, or depriving
it of its noxious Particles, qualify it for
effecting uncommon things in the Cure of
this Disease, without causing the Surgeon to
repent the use of it. I remember that <i>Helmont</i>
somewhere says one may easily enough
correct several sorts of Poisons, so that they
shall not be deprived of their Force, when
we destroy their Virulency. Many Instances
of this Nature we meet with in Mr
<i>Boyle</i>, and some others; but that which
makes most for my present purpose, is,
what is mentioned by the last Honourable
Gentleman, of a very ingenious Man he
knew, that was famous, as well for his
Writings, as for a Remedy to cure <i>ulcerated
Cancers</i> in Womens Breasts, without any
considerable Pain. He assured our Author
that his Medicine was indolent, and mortified
the ulcerated Parts as far as they were
corrupted, without disordering the Party,
and this Remedy it seems partly by the
Confession of the Gentleman, was reasonably
enough supposed to be a Dulcification
of <i>Arsnick</i>; one would think that the mention
of this very Remedy, with Monsieur
<i>Alliot’s</i>, and that recommended in the preceeding
Letter, should be sufficient to influence
the inquisitive of our Profession to
farther Enquiries, which must be certainly
an Undertaking, worthy the noblest Spirits.
To conclude, we cannot say, but there are
many Cancers that may be cured by Causticks,
but the Person that is to undergo it,
may very well answer, as a certain Patient
did, who’s Thigh was to be cut off, <i>Non
est tanto digna dolore Salus</i>. <i>The Preservation
of Life would be too dear bought at the
Price of so much Pain.</i> This puts me in
Mind of what is related of <i>Galienus</i> the
Emperor, who it seems had for a considerable
time been very grieviously afflicted with
a <i>Sciatica</i>, a certain Physician undertaking
to cure him, performed indeed his Promise,
but nevertheless made him undergo a thousand
painful Experiments; whereupon, the
Emperor one Day sent for, and thus said to
him, <i>Take</i> Fabatus <i>two Thousand Sesterces,
but withal, be informed I give them not for
curing my</i> Sciatica, <i>but that thou may’st never
cure me again</i>.</p>


<p class="tac fs140 mt2em"><em class="gesperrt">PROBLEM VI.</em></p>

<p class="tac fs120"><i>Whether Cancers are Curable by internal
Medicines.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">THOUGH</em> this <i>Problem</i> at first View
may seem to be too near allied to
that which proves the Impossibility of curing
cancerous Tumours, whether ulcerated
or not, by Salivation; yet in regard there
are some Persons, that tell us the Disease is
superable by some internal Remedies, which
operate after a quite different Manner, to
those generally given to procure a Salivation,
we shall enquire into one of the most considerable
of them, related by a Person
whose Memory we have a very great Value
for. And we shall the rather take Notice
of this particular Remedy, because we have
elsewhere spoke of the Success of it. It
were no very difficult Matter for me to
mention several internal Medicines, out of
our Chirurgical Writers, more especially
those that have been Favourers of Chemistry;
but I shall purposely decline it, because
to speak freely, I suspect that most of
the Remedies, though much has been said
in the Praise, have not been sufficiently
examined by those that recommended them.
To this we may add, that had the Authors
of them considered the vast Difference
there is to be observed in Cancers, they
would not have so suddainly and positively
determined, that their Medicines were of
use in these Cases in general; seeing we
must have regard to absolutely different Intentions,
in those that are not ulcerated, and
those that are, and those that are a hard
Tumour, and those that are flat, and likewise
when they are conjoined with Circumstances,
which are often enough to be met
with. The Honourable Mr <i>Boyle</i> in his
<i>Usefulness of experimental Philosophy</i>, tells
us, that he was informed by credible Persons,
of a certain <i>English</i> Woman above
sixty Years of Age, who had lain long indisposed
with a Cancer in her Breast, in an
Hospital in <i>Zeeland</i>, and was by Doctor
<i>Harberfeld</i>, with one single inward Remedy
perfectly cured in three Weeks; the Relation
was made by a <i>Doctor of Physick</i>,
who was an Eye Witness of the Cure, and
another Person who not only saw the Cure,
but knew the Woman before, and out of
Charity, carried her to him that healed her.
Our Author was informed, that the <i>Chemical
Liquor</i> the Doctor constantly made use
of, does in the Dose of about a Spoonful or
two, work suddainly and nimbly enough by
Vomit, but hath very quickly ended it’s
Operation, so that within an Hour, or less,
after the Patient has taken it, he is commonly
well again, and very hungry. He
adds, that having some of the Liquor presented
him, he found the Taste to be offensive
enough, and not unlike that of <i>Vitriol</i>,
which by the Taste and emetick Operation,
was guessed to be it’s principal Ingredient.
The Relators assured our Author they had
been in <i>England</i>, as well as elsewhere partly
Eye Witnesses, and partly Performers of
wonderful Cures by the help of it alone,
under God, in the <i>King’s Evil</i>; insomuch,
that an eminent Gentleman of this Nation,
hath been cured by it, when <i>that Distemper</i>
had brought his Arm to such a pass, that the
Surgeons had appointed a time to cut it off.
Now, who is there, that upon reading this
Account would not think the Doctor a very
happy Man, that was Master of so valuable
a Secret; but alas! How satisfactory would
it be to the World if the hundredth part of
the Remedies that have been handed down
to us, had a Power of effecting those things
that are ascribed to them, without being attended
with any ill Consequences. I assure
you, Reader, I have made use of this very
Remedy, for since I mentioned it as the
Doctor’s having great Success from it; I
met with the true Preparation of it, as it
was communicated to Sir <i>Kenelm Digby</i> by
Doctor <i>Havervelt</i>, or <i>Haberfield</i>, for the
Cure of <i>Cancers</i>, the <i>King’s Evil</i>, and old
<i>Ulcers</i>. It is as follows. ℞ <i>Dantzick Vitriol,
calcine it till it be yellow, then grind it
with Salt, or Salt Petre, the ordinary proportion
with this Sublime Mercury, which Sublime
once again by it self, then take only the
Cristaline part of it; of this take</i> ℥i, <i>grind it
to a Subtile Powder in a Glass Mortar with
a Glass Pestle.</i> Put this into a Glass Bottle,
and pour upon it a Quart of Fountain
Water, stop the Bottle close, and let it
stand thus for some Days, shaking it often;
after it is well settled pour off the clear,
and filtre it; take a Spoonful of this Liquor,
which put into a Vial, and put to it two
Spoonfuls of fair Water; shake the Vial
well, and let the Patient Drink it in the
Morning Fasting: As to the quickness of
its Operation, and the making the Patient
Hungry, I found it at first to agree with
what Mr <i>Boyle</i> says of it; but upon giving
it three or four times, the Patient would
afterward complain of a Languidness, which
was ushered in by a Sickness at the Stomach;
after this, they would be attended with a
Heat or Soreness of the Throat, immoderate
Thirst, convulsive Motions of the Stomach,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Some of which Inconveniencies
would continue for many Hours together.
It was upon Account of the Melancholy
Reflections of bringing the Patients
into such Disorder, and their Unwillingness
to endure such Fatigues, that I had never
Courage enough to proceed in this Method.
I cannot but say, upon the Alteration I
found in a Patient of mine, from the use of
six Doses of this Medicine, that it may as
well as some other churlish Remedies, cure
some flat ulcerated Cancers, where there is no
Tumour to dissolve, in Persons that are capable
of often repeating it, which I think
is sufficient to put us upon farther Enquiries,
that we may be able to accomplish such
Undertakings without bringing upon the
Patient such a Train of mischievous Accidents.</p>


<p class="tac fs140 mt2em"><em class="gesperrt"><i>POSTSCRIPT.</i></em></p>

<p>What follows is taken from a Manuscript
which at this time 1714–15, belongs to one
of the Family of the <i>Pains</i>, that have for a
long time pretended to cure Cancers: In the
Margin is this Note, (<i>Used by my Father,
and Grandfather, and Brothers, and known
as a thing excellent by long Practice in our
Family of the</i> Pains:) The Book was lent
me by my Brother <i>Dobyns</i>, who had it from
one of the Family, a Patient of his.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>The Red Caustick.</i></p>

<p>To eat all Superfluous Cancerous and
Schirrous Matters gathered hard in the Edges
or Sides of any Ulcer or Cancer, breeding
upon the Mouth, Face, Nose or Valva. Take
of Bole Armoniac one Ounce, of yellow
Arsnic three Ounces, powder them and
searse them fine, pare an Apple or two and
take of the Pulp and put so much of it
to the Powder (beating of it together in a
Mortar) as will make it of the stiffness of
Dough, then make it up into round Balls
of the bigness of a Walnut, dry them in
a Chamber-Window till they be hard enough.
When you use these Balls shave a little off
from them into your Hand, and moisten the
same with a little Spittle, and rub it well
about the hard Foot of the <i>Noli me Tangere</i>,
and all over the Head of the same, and after
that you have gathered him up into the Ligature
and knit him hard up (for it seems
they used a Ligature smeared with the Medicine)
then apply your Preparation before-mentioned,
and lay fine Holland Raggs dipt
in the following Red Water, all over the
said Caustic, and so let it lye till it fall off
its self. <i>Note</i>, The Quantity of Caustic
laid on, ought not to be much, and yet
sufficient to work its effect. It worketh with
great Pain for twelve Hours or more, and
after that by Fits, like the Tooth-Ach; as the
Pain worketh off it causes great Inflammation
and Swelling about those Parts it is applied
to, but this does not continue above
four or five Days; so meddle not with it till
the Caustick comes off. Then you may for
three or four Days dress the Inflammation
with Diachylon Plaister, or the Red Water
warm.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>The Red Water for a Cancer.</i></p>

<p>Quench unslacked Lime in boiling Water,
which let stand six Hours, the clear
Water poured off, put to the Fire again; to
a Gallon and half of which, put <i>Camphir</i>
℥ß <i>Aloes Succatrine</i> ℥ß. <i>Common Bole</i> ℥ii
<i>White Copperas or Allum</i> ℥ii all powdered,
which boil in the Liquor a little while: He
sometimes gave a Pill made of Deflograted
Red Precipitate, which sometimes made
them spit a little.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>The Musilage Plaister to dissolve Schirrous
Knots in the Breast.</i></p>

<p>Take of the white and inward Bark of
the Witch-Hasel half a Handful, cut it short
and stamp it, then take of the Roots of
Marsh Mallows, Holy-hock Roots two or
three Roots, clean them and throw away
the Pith, stamp all together, then take of
Fenugreek and Linseed of each two Ounces
powdered, put all in an Earthen-pot, then
take a Pint of white Wine or Water, heat
it scalding hot, put it to the Things aforesaid,
cover it close, stirring it every Day for
nine Days, then strain out the Musilage Liquor
with which you make the following
Plaister. Take a Pint of Salad Oyl, Cerus
finely powdered 8 Ounces, boil them together,
constantly stirring them, a sufficient
time, which you may know by its coming
clear off a Pewter Dish when dropt on, let
it cool a little and put in your Musilage,
which stir till it be as white as you would
have it, and until almost all the Musilage
be boiled away, then remove it from the
Fire and put to it four Ounces of <i>yellow
Wax</i>, probably <i>Galbanum</i> may be better,
which when dissolved and the Plaister cold,
work up for use. This Plaister is sometimes
used with equal Parts of <i>Galbanum</i>.</p>

several <i>Physicians</i> and <i>Surgeons</i> have before,
and since his Death, given themselves the
Liberty to reflect, not only upon me for
Using, but also upon the Deceased for submitting
to the Methods that were taken with
him; I think I shall not discharge my Duty,
either to my Friend, or to my Self, or indeed
to the Profession, if I do not, as far as
I am able, endeavour to set what was done
in a True Light.</p>

<p>In order thereunto, it may be requisite to
look back to the Time He first mentioned
any Disorder in his Mouth to me, which
was in <i>August</i> 1716. He then told me, He
had preceived a Fulness in his Mouth for
very many Years; but in the last Three or
Four Years it was much encreased, and by
the Bulk began to be troublesome to him,
tho’ not in the least painful: Upon examining
it, I found the Tumour not only large,
but also to fluctuate, and therefore told him,
until I was satisfied what was contained in
it, I could not come to a Resolution, as to
the manner of treating it; but, if he pleased,
I would make an Incision into it, and
then would tell him what I thought was fit
to be done; He was very well satisfied,
and resolved I should proceed accordingly.</p>

<p>Upon Opening it, there appeared to be
nothing contained in it, but Blood; not in
the least altered in Colour, Consistence, or
Smell, from what is contained in the Vessels.
The Tumour presently sunk very much,
and I dilated the Incision with my Probe-Scissers,
and pressed in some <i>Dossels</i>; and
then told him, it was a fleshy Tumour, called
a <i>Sarcoma</i>, and that the Blood contained
in it was only accidental; and that the
best way of extirpating it was by the actual
<i>Cautery</i>; but I let him know, that I feared
it would be more troublesome to him, and
take longer Time to cure, than he seemed
to expect.</p>

<p>We presently sent for the best <i>Instrument-Maker</i>
the Country afforded, and gave him
Directions: But that Night: talking with
him of his Case, I desired him to consider,
Whether it might not be thought a Slight,
by the Learned of both Professions, if I
should Perform the Operation, upon a Man
of his Character, without a Consultation;
there being no Reason (but the Loss of his
Time) to be in haste. At first he seemed unwilling
to lose so much Time, yet upon
Consideration, he resolved for <i>London</i> the
next Day, where several <i>Physicians</i> and <i>Surgeons</i>
were consulted; they all agreed, it
was a simple <i>Sarcoma</i>, and that the actual
<i>Cautery</i> was the properest, if not the only
means of curing it. This Account I received
from the Doctor by Letter; as also, that
the <i>Surgeons</i>, upon probing, found the Bone
bare, and from the ill Smell concluded it
was foul: “Which, said the Doctor it was
impossible for you to discover; because
after I left <i>Northampton</i>, Two <i>Dossels</i> of
the first Dressing dropt out.” I was very
glad to hear That, for those <i>Dossels</i> lodging
so long, in that warm Part, I was in hopes
might be the Occasion of the fœtid Smell;
which the <i>Surgeons</i>, not being acquainted
with, might fairly be induced to take for
that of a foul Bone: Which I mentioned
to the Doctor by the first return of the Post;
and also, that I was farther encouraged in
that Hope, by considering that the Blood,
that was discharged at the first Opening,
was not at all altered, neither was any Smell
perceived, until after the lodging of those
<i>Dossels</i>.</p>

<p>Whether the Doctor ever mentioned this
my Opinion, to the <i>Surgeons</i> in Town, I
know not; but when he returned to me,
to have the Operation performed, he seemed
discouraged by the Opinion the <i>Surgeons</i>
gave of the Bones being foul. But I
thought I might make bold to confirm him,
in my former Opinion, the ill Smell ceasing
without the Assistance of Medicines. The
Consequence proved the Assertion: For
when, by several Applications of the <i>Cauteries</i>,
I had removed the whole Tumor,
it was plain to me, the Bone was not affected;
and the Part healed as smooth, and
with as much Ease, and in as short a Time,
as ever I met any thing of that Nature,
and the Doctor continued well, without
the least Disorder or Complaint, a Year
and about Eight Months.</p>

<p>But then in <i>April</i> 1718. He shewed me
a small <i>Ulcer</i>, near that Part of the Mouth
that was before affected, and told me, He
perceived it began upon eating some hot
Meat, that stuck to it: At first this healed
without much Trouble, but soon excoriated
again; and then I could not again perfectly
skin it: For as soon as it was almost
healed, it would begin to excoriate a-fresh
at the Edges, which is what is usual in
<i>Phagedænical Ulcers</i>. And tho’ I could digest
it, and keep it easy, yet it got ground
of me, and spread towards the Teeth; and,
near the Root of One of the <i>Molares</i>, laid
the Bone bare, which appeared to me at the
first not to be injured, but being long exposed
became foul. It not exfoliating in
due Time, with the Tincture that is commonly
used, I proposed the touching of
it with a small <i>Cautery</i>, I being able very
easily to come at it without making use of a
<i>Cannula</i>; which, by confining the Heat,
very much injures the neighbouring Parts:
The good Effect of which Practice, of not
making use of a <i>Cannula</i>, where you can
conveniently omit it, I had good Experience
of in Doctor <i>KEIL</i>’s former Case: For
tho’ he had several <i>Cannulas</i> made in <i>London</i>,
by the best Hand, yet after Twice
using of them, I told the Doctor, That if a
Patient could be trusted, it would be much
more easy to him, and the Surgeon would
see much better to use the <i>Cautery</i>, than
when obstructed by a <i>Cannula</i>. The Doctor
was pleased with the Thought, and pressed
me, at the next making use of the <i>Cautery</i>,
to do it without the <i>Cannula</i>: The Advantage
he had by it was, that it bore four
Burnings, and said, It gave him not the
Pain, or Trouble he had from but One before,
and that the Parts were much less Disordered
by it afterwards. But to return:</p>

<p>It will not I suppose be doubted, but that
proper internal Means were all along made
use of: But the <i>Ulcer</i> still appearing to me
more threatening, his Friends pressed him,
and I more than any, that he would go again
to Town, and have the best Advice it
could afford; and I resolved to accompany
Him, in the Beginning of <i>August</i> 1718.
And I cannot forbear saying I was surprized,
when, upon a Consultation, my
Brothers, <i>Palmer</i> and <i>Brown</i>, made light of
it; and, without so much as hearing what
I had to say, concluded, That it was chiefly
owing to the Bones being foul; and that
by drawing a Tooth or Two which they
said were affected, and by Purging with
<i>Mercurius dulcis</i>, all would be well; and
so they took their Leave. Says the Doctor
to me, “What say you to this?” I answered
him, That I feared they would find themselves
again mistaken as to the <i>Surgery</i>
Part; and that as to the <i>Mercury</i>, though
a good Medicine, He knew he had taken
it already several Times, without any considerable
Advantage. The Doctor smiled
and said, “But since I came so far for Advice,
I will not only give them a Tooth,
but also try again what Effect <i>Mercury</i>
may have.”</p>

<p>Another Meeting was ordered, and the
Tooth-Drawer to be there: Upon Drawing
the Tooth, it appeared to be very sound.
The First Dose he took of <i>Mercury</i>, whether
by Cold, or any other Accident, I
know not, very much disordered him. I
could not conveniently be absent any longer,
and therefore the next Day returned into
the Country, and do not know how many
more Doses the Doctor then took; but in a
few Days I received a Letter from him, in
which he said, “I know nothing that has
succeeded right with me, since I came
here: You know what State you left me
in, and I was a great deal worse for some
Days afterwards; though I hope the
<i>Mercury</i> has had no ill Effect, yet I should
have been loath to have been so swelled
in those Parts, as I have been, willingly.
The old <i>Ulcers</i> are not yet healed, they tell
me indeed, there is no Appearance of any
new Ones, and that the <i>most effectual</i> Methods,
which have been taken here, will
<i>infallibly</i> prevent every thing, <i>&amp;c</i>.”</p>

<p>But by his next, which I soon received,
I had the melancholy News from him,
That the <i>Ulcer</i> was broke out again larger
than ever, and therefore that he would be
down with me in a Day or two, and he
came accordingly, but in a worse State than
ever before. And though it again digested,
and did as before near heal, yet the returns
were quicker, and upon every new Eruption
it was larger and worse; and so continued
to be, notwithstanding all the good
internal Methods continually used by the
concurring Advice of Dr <i>Mead</i>, Dr <i>Friend</i>,
and several other Eminent <i>Physicians</i>;
which no doubt was owing to the malignant
Nature of it.</p>

<p>And therefore in the Beginning of <i>February</i>
last, I could no longer forbear expressing
my Fears to the Doctor that it
would terminate in a raging <i>Cancer</i>. He
was too sensible of it, and told me, “That
since I thought I could keep it within
Bounds no longer, He was resolved to try
what a <i>Salivation</i> would do:” And though
I could say nothing as to the Advantage he
might expect from it, yet I frankly owned
to him, that if it was my own Case, I
should be of his Opinion, that I might
make bolder with my self, than with any
other Patient: But desired by all means, he
would first hear if his Friends, the <i>Physicians</i>
and <i>Surgeons</i> in <i>London</i>, had yet any
other Method to propose, or else would approve
of that. He wrote to them, the
Answer was long in coming, which made
the Doctor express himself to me with more
Warmth, than I ever knew him to do before:
(For he was a Man of the greatest
Command of himself, as well as of the
sweetest Temper) “What, says he, is not
their Silence enough? And will not you,
whom I take for my Friend (for fear of
losing your Reputation) assist me in what
I desire?” With a great deal more to assure
me of his Confidence in me, and of
his Opinion of my Ability to take Care of
him in the Course. I am not so vain, as to
mention all his kind Expressions, yet if it
be desired, by any of his Friends, I will
give them the Satisfaction of seeing the Letters
I had from him, when he was absent
from me in <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>At this Time his Brother, Doctor <i>John
Keil</i>, came to him from <i>Oxford</i>; and, as I
understood afterwards, had seen Dr <i>Friend</i>
there, who was for having him salivated at
<i>London</i>: But the Doctor being determined
to the contrary, did not at that Time acquaint
me with it, but began his Course,
which I desired might be in the mildest
Method, by small Doses of <i>Calomel</i>, encreased
gradually, which Method pleased
him very well: But Dr <i>Friend</i> (to whom Dr
<i>John Keil</i> constantly sent an Account of our
Proceedings) gave it as the Opinion of Mr
<i>Palmer</i> and Mr <i>Brown</i>, that it should be
done by <i>Unction</i>: I gave my Reason to the
Patient against it, but they still pressed it,
notwithstanding the ill Symptoms, that I
thought, at that Time, forbad it; which
Symptoms they had been acquainted with.
They still persisting, I desired the Doctor
would give me leave to write my Opinion
my self to Mr <i>Brown</i>, which I did hastily
in the following manner.</p>

<p>Good Brother,</p>

<p class="dropcap1"><i>I Have seen Dr</i> Friend’s <i>Letter to Dr</i>
Keil; <i>and Dr</i> Friend <i>I understand has
been so kind as to consult you, and several
Others in the Case; whose Judgments, though
I have all due Regard for, yet in the present
Circumstances (though I give the Preference
to</i> Unction <i>in some stubborn Cases) I dare not
encourage it in this: For my Reason at first,
for beginning so mildly, was, that in this
uncommon Case, we might by degrees, make
some Judgment of the Effects of</i> Mercury,
<i>and then proceed accordingly: For had I not
been prevented by the Accidents you have, by
Dr</i> Friend, <i>been acquainted with, I should
have been very desirous to have gone at least to
the Heighth mentioned by Dr</i> Friend. <i>But
since I find, by encreasing the Quantity of
the Dose to a</i> Scruple <i>(of which he has taken
four) it has not affected the Glands at all,
or made him Spit the more; but his Stomach
is much more oppressed by it, with vast Quantity
of Phlegm, viscous to a degree I have not
met with, and gives him more than common
Disturbance, not to be relieved but by often
Vomiting, to which purpose the</i> Turpith,
<i>has answered very well for the present: My
great Fear is, all things considered, that if I
should proceed to</i> Unction, <i>and it should produce
the same Effect, that it will be too many
for him. If my Fears are too great, my
more than common Concern and Friendship is
some Excuse for me; as also I desire it may
be to You, for this tedious Account from</i>,
Sir,</p>

<p class="ml60pc">Yours, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Feb. 22d, 1718.</p>

<p class="ml60pc mb1em"><span class="smcap">J. Rushworth</span>.</p>

<p>I not receiving, in due Time, an Answer
to this, and the Patient being reduced to a
great Weakness, and to so great a Disorder,
that he could not bear Talking to, I writ
these few Lines for him to consider of.</p>


<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="dropcap"><i>AS your Case now stands, I must own my
self a Coward: Though Dr</i> Friend <i>is much
mistaken to think I am either unacquainted
with, or fear the common Accidents that
often arise in Salivating: But that irregular
and uncommon Effects are, in extraordinary
Cases, produced by</i> Mercury, Hale’<i>s Case is
to me a sufficient Precedent, of which I have
formerly told you the Particulars; and though
your Friends in Town took no Notice of the
unusual Disorder in your Stomach, yet I
should think myself Inexcusable if I should
not. And if, upon using an</i> Unction, <i>any
irregular Ferments should again arise, weak
as you now are, I should dread the Consequence.
In these Circumstances, I think
it most prudent for me, to advise you, to let
what is already taken, go fairly off, and
if you find it not effectual, you may with
much better Prospect, when you have Strength,
begin</i> de Nova, <i>by</i> Unction, <i>and have an
Opportunity to have it done by the</i> infallible
<i>Men</i>.</p>

<p>Upon this the Doctor no longer, at present,
pressed me to use the <i>Unction</i>, and in
a few Days, the Force of what he had
taken being somewhat spent, he began to
get Strength, and the very great Slough
(which was one of the Accidents mentioned
to Dr <i>Friend</i>) not only cast off, but also
healed, as did also the old malignant <i>Ulcer</i>,
and all the Parts of the Mouth looked very
smooth and well; and the Doctor was
very chearful, and in great Hopes of gaining
the Point.</p>

<p>At this Time, it being eighteen Days
since I wrote to Mr <i>Brown</i>, I received a
Letter from him, in which he mentioned
nothing to the Purpose. This, I must confess,
did not a little warm me; and I the
same Night wrote to him again, but never
received any Answer: Perhaps he thought
mine too hot; if so, if he desires it, both
mine, and his that occasioned it, shall be
produced.</p>

<p>The Doctor seeing what had been done
to have so good Effect, and hoping what
was before advised by Mr <i>Palmer</i> and
Mr <i>Brown</i>, would effectually prevent any
return of his Disorder, resolved to use a
<i>Mercurial Unction</i>. He had now more
Strength, and therefore I complied with
him; I began with a small Quantity, and
encreased it every Time, until I had used
even a larger Quantity than had been proposed
by Dr <i>Friend</i>: But it not in the least
affected the Glands, or made him to spit
near so much, as when he took the <i>Calomel</i>;
neither did the <i>Unction</i> or <i>Calomel</i>
produce the Smell, which generally attends
<i>Mercurial</i> Courses; and to my great Surprize
and Concern, whilst he was using the
<i>Unction</i>, the <i>Ulcer</i> broke out again. And
by this we were discouraged from proceeding
any farther; and in due Time the Doctor
endeavoured to Purge this off, but he
had always so untoward a Constitution, that
neither now, nor at any Time before, could
he by Purges have any regular Evacuation;
which was, no doubt in his Case, very Injurious
to him.</p>

<p>Now I perfectly desponded: But a Friend
and Kinsman of the Doctor’s, a <i>Surgeon</i>
of no small Reputation, assured him, that
he had known, when other Methods failed,
a <i>Mercurial Fumigation</i> had answered:
And what is it that a rational Man will not
try to prevent the excruciating Pains of a
<i>Cancer?</i> When the Doctor mentioned this
to me, I confessed I knew nothing of that
Practice, and always had an ill Opinion of
the Fumes of <i>Mercury</i>: And he also owned
to me, that he was wholly unacquainted with
it; but satisfied in his Friend, and therefore
would try it: He began the Course according
to his Friend’s Directions; I never
pretended to order any thing afterwards;
but however still frequently visited my Good
Friend, though with an aking Heart. The
Fumigation not only made him spit, whilst
he was using it, but also for some Hours
afterwards; and the Patient continued to
use it for several Days, but without any good
Effect upon the <i>Ulcer</i>. In about ten Days
after he had left off the Fumigation, a very
hard Tumour began to arise, upon the
Muscles of the lower Part of the Face and
Neck, and increased very fast, and in a very
short Time spread it self from Ear to Ear:
and, by the Bulk, in a great measure prevented
his Swallowing, and soon suffocated
him. He was Chearful, and to all outward
Appearance tolerably easy to the last,
and had what he now desired, a gentle Release,
<i>July 16, 1719</i>.</p>

<p>And thus, to the Misfortune of Mankind,
it is manifest to me, that <i>Mercury</i> is not
adequate to this <i>Herculean</i> Distemper: but
however, this Case, and That I mentioned
before to the Doctor, gives me good Reason
to believe, that <i>Mercurials</i> do at least blunt
the Acrimony of the Humour, and so procure
Ease. For, though that Patient had
most acute Pains, before he entered into a
<i>Mercurial</i> Course, yet afterwards he was
easy all a long, as he told me; for I was
called in but a few Days before he died.
These, and other melancholly Cases, should
not however, I think, wholly discourage
<i>Surgeons</i> from making rational Attempts
upon a Distemper, which I fear is more
frequently met with, than formerly, in
this Part of the World: It is to be hoped,
there is in Nature a Specific that may
answer; and happy will that Man be who
shall discover it. He will deserve to be
placed next to the Great <i>Hippocrates</i>, and
also to be rewarded, by the Publick, equally
with him that shall find out the
<i>Longitude</i>.</p>

<p>I will not pretend to determine, how far
the Fumigation might contribute to the
sudden growth of the Tumour mentioned,
but I should be very glad that the <i>Surgeon</i>
who recommended it, would be so ingenuous,
as to vindicate himself, by giving
Instances of it’s Innocency, and of the
Advantages he has met with in the Practice
of it.</p>

<p>And now I heartily beg Pardon of the
Friends of the Deceased, who shall give
themselves the Trouble of Reading this
Account, that I could not bring it into a
narrower Compass.</p>

<p class="mt2em">Having truly related what was done, in
the Case of Dr <i>Keil</i>, I hope it may appear,
that I have acted an honest, and not an
unskilful Part in it: If what was prescribed
by others of greater Fame, when it came
to be tried, had not better Success, I presume
I shall no longer be blamed for it.
No Man would willingly lose any Reputation,
who is to live by it. I question not, but
the best <i>Surgeons</i> in the World will allow,
there are Cases for which there is no Remedy:
And he who frankly owns thus much,
no more loses any Reputation, than the
Quack, that promises greater Matters than
he afterwards performs, gets any: And I
think they, who have censured me, would
have done more ingenuously, if they would
rather have looked upon the present Case as
incurable by any <i>Surgeon</i>, than have thrown
their Aspersions upon me, as not treating it
properly.</p>

<p><i>N.&nbsp;B.</i> The foregoing remarkable <i>Case</i>
of Dr <i>Keil</i>, was published by Mr <i>Rushworth</i>
of <i>Northampton</i>, Surgeon at <i>Oxford</i>, in the
Year <span class="nowrap">1719<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>. Under the <i>Imprimatur</i> of
<i>Robert Shippen</i>, Vice-Can. <i>Oxon.</i></p>

<p><a id="dissection"></a></p>
<p class="hang mt2em"><i>Some</i> curious Observations <i>made</i> (<i>by my
Friend</i> John Ranby, <i>Esq</i>; <i>Surgeon to his
Majesty’s Household</i>, <i>and F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S.</i>) <i>in the</i>
Dissection <i>of</i> Three Subjects, 1728.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">THE</em> <i>first</i>, a Man aged 70 Years, who
died of a Suppression of Urine, occasioned
by a Stone stopping in the <i>Urethra</i>, just
within the <i>Glans</i>, of the bigness of a Horse
Bean. This Appearance, with the Symptoms
that had attended this miserable Man,
gave me reason to expect something remarkable
in the urinary Passages. The <i>Ureters</i>
and <i>Pelvis</i> were very much distended;
which is common where great Numbers of
Stones have descended down them, from
the Kidneys to the Bladder. The Bladder
contained about 60 Stones, the largest of
which was about the Size of a Walnut,
the others smaller; and just within the
Neck, was a hard <i>Tumour</i>, as big as a Nutmeg,
which almost closed the Orifice:
and indeed the Situation of this Tumour
was such, that it not only made the passing
the <i>Catheter</i> very difficult, and hindered our
feeling the Stones, by directing the Instrument
upwards: but likewise would alone produce
the Symptoms of the Stone in the
Bladder, by obstructing the free Discharge
of Urine through the <i>Urethra</i>, the inner
Membrane of which appeared as if lacerated
in several Places, and the Tube filled with
a glutinous Matter tinged with Blood. On
the back Part of the <i>Vesiculæ Seminales</i>,
near the <i>Prostata</i>, were several <i>Stones</i>, as
large as Peas, which closely adhered to the
adjacent Membranes.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i>, a Boy aged 10 Years, killed
by a Blow on the Skull; whose Spleen
weighed two Pounds, and possessed almost
all the left Side of the abdominal Cavity.
The Bladder, when distended to its greatest
Capacity, would not contain an <i>Ounce</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i>, a Man aged 25, who died of
a Pocky Hectick, and some Days before
complained of a painful Swelling in the
Testicle, which he said came the Night
before. I examined it, and found it to
be a <i>Hernia Aquosa</i>, and would have punctured
it, if I had not felt (besides the
Water) a hard Body, which I could by no
Means reduce. In a few Days he died,
which gave me an Opportunity of being
satisfied. Opening the <i>Scrotum</i>, and separating
the common Membranes to the
<i>Processus Vaginalis</i>, it contained about 4
Ounces of Water, besides a great Part of
the <i>Omentum</i>; some Portions of which adhered
to the Bottom of the Cavity, and the
<i>Albuginea</i> that immediately covers the
Testicle.</p>

<p class="mt2em">It has been likewise thought proper to
preserve a <i>small Treatise</i> of curing <i>Consumptions</i>
by a new Method, of administring
<i>Specific-Medicines</i>, more especially <i>such</i> as
proceed from <i>Ulcers</i> of the <i>Lungs</i>.</p>

<p>This excellent Piece was written by the
late eminent Mr <i>Thomas Nevett</i>, of <i>Fen-Church
Street</i>, Surgeon.</p>

</h2>

<p class="dropcap1">I Remember a remarkable Passage in some
<i>Observations</i> upon the <i>Bermudus</i> Berries,
by a Doctor of Physic in the Country,
addressed to the Hon. <i>Robert Boyle</i>, Esq;
who professeth he had been for 50 Years
an exact Observer of the <i>Methodus Medendi</i>;
yet saith the Doctor for my part I firmly
believe, that (<i>Universal Evacuations</i> being
premised) the greatest Cures wrought in
the World, are by the use of <i>Specifical
Medicines</i>. The higher the Attainments of
any have been in Understanding, the more
freely have they acknowledged that the
greatest part of those <i>things</i> they <i>did know</i>,
was the least of those <i>things</i> they <i>did not
know</i>; such Men account it not shameful
to renounce an Errour, tho’ ever so ancient,
when persuaded thereunto by Truth
and plain Demonstration: There are other
narrow Spirits (abundantly satisfied in their
own Knowledge) who believe the <i>Art</i> of
<i>Physic</i> hath been taught by our Ancestors,
in such an absolutely perfect manner, as
that nothing remains to the Industry and
Diligence of Posterity; it being too much
their Humour to undervalue every Medicine
that they themselves are not Masters of, because
they prefer their private Interest to the
public Good: But in the mean time
where is that cordial Love to Mankind,
which is one of the Badges of true Christianity?
Nay, where is the Exercise of Reason?
For how can a Man give his Opinion
against a thing that he never <i>heard of</i> before,
or at least never <i>experienced</i>? I am sure, this
unjustifiable Practice is the way to put a stop
to all useful Knowledge and Improvements:
It is therefore expected from the Ingenious
and Candid Reader, that he should adhere
to the Cause of Truth, by whomsoever it
is pleaded, weigh every Invention, not in
the deceitful <i>Balance</i> of <i>Custom</i>, but in
the just and even <i>Scales</i> of <i>Reason</i>; approve
what is agreeable, and reject what is contrary
to it.</p>

<p>That I who am by Profession a Surgeon,
should in such a polite and inquisitive Age,
venture my Thoughts in public concerning
a <i>Physical Case</i>, may be to some matter of
Admiration, and to others of severe Censure;
especially such as may think I have invaded
their Province. As for the latter, I am
persuaded nothing that I can say will remove
their Prejudices; and for the former,
I shall only tell them, that being alarmed
by some of the <i>Symptoms</i> mentioned in the
following Discourse, whereby I plainly
perceived the Constitution of my own Body
inclined to a <i>Consumptive State</i>, I strenuously
applied my Mind to study the Nature of
this <i>Disease</i>, and to find out, if possible,
some noble Specific Medicines, which might
indeed deserve that Name, and be able to
oppose the growth of so fatal a Distemper,
which hath insensibly flattered so many into
the Chambers of Death. What I then
laboured for, and searched after, I have
since (by the Blessing of God) found, and
with great Advantage experimented on my
self and many others, and now think fit to
disclose for the good of All, not doubting
but if a more excellent Method and Medicine
than hath hitherto been generally administered,
or prescribed, be treasured up
in the Hands of any Person whatsoever, he
doth more faithfully perform the part of a
just Steward, by a due Improvement, than
a close Concealment of it. And on the
same Account, I judge it more my Duty to
serve my Native Country, than mind the
Clamours of censorious Critics; not at all
questioning but in a little time, the Efficacy
of <i>these Medicines</i> will at once bring Health
to the Patient, and Reputation to their
Author: And the World will be convinced
of the <i>Power</i> of these <i>Remedies</i>, by their
Effects; tho’ ignorant Persons may be apt
to contemn and neglect, till their Opinions
be altered by <i>Experience</i>, and their Prejudices
removed by <i>Demonstration</i>.</p>


<p class="tac mtb1em"><i>Of the Nature, Causes, and Symptoms of
Consumptions.</i></p>

<p>I. A <i>Consumption</i>, in general, is a wasting
of all the solid parts of the
Body, for want of a due Distribution, or
Assimilation of the Nutritious Juices.</p>

<p>By some learned Men this is observed to
be the <i>Endemical Distemper</i> of <i>England</i>;
and indeed our <i>Weekly-Bills</i> at once declare
both the Strength of the Disease, and the
Weakness of the Medicines wherewith it’s
Cure hath been hitherto attempted. Besides,
that which seems to justify this Observation,
is the pernicious Custom of the
Inhabitants of this island, who immoderately
and unseasonably indulge their Appetites
with several sorts of Meats and Drinks,
whereby the Tone of the Stomach is so
vitiated, as that it cannot perfectly ferment
and volatilize the Chyle, which is commonly
the internal procatartic Cause of most
Distempers among us, and consequently of
<i>Consumptions</i> from those Distempers, from
whence comes a Colliquation of the Chyle
in <i>Lienteries</i> and <i>Dysenteries</i>, tormenting
<i>Cholic</i> and <i>Iliac</i> Pains, hypocondriac Melancholly,
hysteric Fits, scorbutic Twitches,
troublesome Catarrhs, sluggish Passage of
the Chyle thro’ the milky Veins, scrophulous
Tumours and Inflammations of the
mesenteric Glands, spasmodic Contractions
or Convulsions of the Nerves, preternatural
Fermentation of the Blood and Spirits, <i>Cachexies</i>,
<i>Atrophies</i>, Obstructions, Fevers hectical,
inflammatory and putrid, Exulcerations
of the Lungs and <i>Marasmus</i>, with
many other Diseases, whence come they
originally and for the most part, but from
the Weakness, ill Habit and Indisposition of
the Stomach?</p>

<p>Now the proper Action of the Stomach
is Chylification; for tho’ the Meat we take
into our Mouths receives some Alteration
there in Mastication, by the fermenting
Juice that flows from the salivatory Glands,
together with the acrimonious Particles,
and fermentaceous Spirits of Liquors which
we drink, yet it is not turned into a thick
white Juice, ’till it hath passed down thro’
the <i>Oesophagus</i>, or Gullet, into the Stomach,
where by the help of it’s Fibres it is
closely embraced, and mixed with specific
fermentaceous Juices, separated by it’s inner
Coat, and impregnated by the Saliva, then
by a convenient Heat there is made a mixture
of all; for that the fermentaceous Particles
entering into the Pores of the Meat,
do pass thro’ agitate and eliquate it’s Particles,
dissolving the whole <i>Compages</i>, in
which the purer parts were intimately united
with the Crass, and making them more
fluid, so that they make another form of
Mixture, and unite among themselves into
the resemblance of a milky Cream, after
which together with the thicker Mass with
which they are yet involved, by the Constriction
of the Stomach they pass down to
the Guts, where by the Mixture of the
Bile and Pancreatic Juice they are by another
manner of Fermentation quite separated
from the thicker Mass, and so are received
by the Lacteal Vessels, as the thicker
is ejected by Stool.</p>

<p>After the purer part of the Chyle hath
been thus strained thro’ the narrow and oblique
Pores of the milky Veins, by the continual
and peristaltic Motion of the Intestines,
it is yet farther attenuated and diluted with
a very thin and clear <i>Lympha</i> from the
Glands of the Mesentery to expedite its
passage thro’ those numerous Meanders into
the common Receptacle, from whence
by the constant Supply of such like <i>Lympha</i>
from the small Glands of the <i>Thorax</i>,
it is safely conveyed thro’ the <i>Ductus Chyliferus
Thoracius</i>, subclavian Vein, and the
<i>Vena Cava</i> into the Heart.</p>

<p>The Chyle now mingled with the Blood,
passeth with it thro’ the Arteries of the whole
Body, and returns again with the Blood by
the Veins to the Heart, undergoing many
Circulations before it can be assimilated to
the Blood; for every time the new infused
Chyle passeth thro’ the Heart with the
Blood, the Particles of the one are more intimately
mixed with those of the other, in
it’s Ventricles, and the Vital Spirit, and
other active Principles of the Blood work
upon the Chyle, which being full of Salt,
Sulphur and Spirit, as soon as it’s <i>Compages</i>
is loosned by it’s Fermentation with the
Blood, the Principles having obtained the
Liberty of Motion, do readily associate
themselves, and are assimilated with such
parts of the Blood as are of a like and
suitable Nature.</p>

<p>After the Chyle hath been thus elaborated,
it becomes fit as well to recruit the
Mass of Blood, as to nourish the whole
Body, seeing it consists of divers Principles
and Parts of a different Nature; therefore, according
to the various Use and Necessity of
every part, and also that it may conform
and fashion it self to the different Pores and
Passages, it is severally appropriated; the
most volatile and subtil part is separated in
the Brain, and adapted to refresh the Animal
Spirits, the glutinous to nourish the
Body, and the sulphureous to revive the
native Heat: And in it’s Passage with the
Blood thro’ all the parts of the Body, all
the Mass of Chyle that is capable of being
turned into Blood is sanguified; the serous
and saline part precipitated by the Kidneys,
and evacuated by Sweats or insensible Transpirations,
the bilious is deposited in the
Liver, and the rest of its Excrements retire
to the several Emunctories of the Body.</p>

<p>Thus it comes to pass by the wonderful
Sagacity of Nature, such extraordinary Provision
is made, that the purer part of the
Chyle by these ways and means is more
purified; and when it is thus purified and
sublimed, it is more capable of reinforcing
the Blood and Spirits, as also of corroborating
the Tone of every particular Part:
Whereas when the Chyle is sour and dispirited,
the Blood necessarily becomes vappid,
the animal Spirits which reside in the
System of the Nerves are infected with a
Morbid Disposition, and all parts of the
Body begin to flag and waste. For indeed
there is no other way to recruit the daily
Expence of Blood and Spirits, but by a
continual Influx of laudable Chyle into the
Blood-Vessels, which Chyle is made by the
Fermentative Juice of the Stomach, and
this Fermentative Juice supplied from the
Mass of Blood, so that there plainly appears
to be a fixed Correspondence betwixt
the Blood and the Chyle, and a necessary
Dependance all the Humours in the Habit
of the Body have on the Stomach; from
whence it is reasonable to infer, That if the
Chilifying Faculty of the Stomach be depraved,
the Blood and Humours must necessarily
sympathize therewith, and in a
manner proportionable to the Distemper of
this part.</p>

<p>II. The immediate Cause of a <i>Consumption</i>
of the <i>Lungs</i> is store of sharp, malignant,
waterish Humours, continually distilling
upon the soft spungy Substance of
the Lungs, stuffing, inflaming, impostumating,
and exulcerating them, whereby their
Action, which is Respiration, or a receiving-in
and driving-out Air is depraved, as
will more clearly appear by the following
Description of these Parts. It will not be
impertinent to our Discourse if we should
usher in the Description of the <i>Lungs</i>, with
a short Account of the <i>Trachea</i>, <i>Aspera
Arteria</i>, or <i>Wind-pipe</i>.</p>

<p>III. The <i>Trachea</i> or <i>Aspera Arteria</i> is a
long Pipe, consisting of Cartilages and
Membranes, which beginning at the Throat
or lower part of the Jaws, and lying upon
the Gullet, descends into the <i>Lungs</i>, thro’
which it spreads into many Branchings, and
is commonly divided into two parts, the
<i>Larynx</i> and <i>Bronchus</i>; the <i>Larynx</i> is the
upper part of the Wind-pipe, the <i>Bronchus</i>
is all the <i>Trachea</i> besides the <i>Larynx</i>,
as well before as after it arrives at the
<i>Lungs</i>.</p>

<p>The Substance of the <i>Lungs</i> is soft,
spongy and rare, curiously compacted of
most thin and fine Membranes, continued
with the Ramifications of the <i>Trachea</i> or
Wind-pipe, which Membranes compose an
infinite number of little, round and hollow
Vesicles, or Bladders, so placed as that there
is an open Passage from the Branches of the
<i>Aspera Arteria</i>, out of one into another,
and all terminate at the outer Membrane
that investeth the whole <i>Lungs</i>: These little
Bladders by help of their muscular Fibres
contract themselves in Expiration, and
are dilated in Inspiration, partly by the
Pressure of the Atmosphere, and partly by
the elastic Power of the Air, insinuating
it self into these Vesicles thro’ the Windpipe
and it’s several Branches: Their Lobes
are two, the right and left, parted by the
<i>Mediastinum</i>, each of which is divided into
many lesser Lobules, according to the Ramifications
of the <i>Aspera Arteria</i>; they
have all sorts of Vessels that are common
to them with other parts, as Arteries, Veins,
Nerves, Lympheducts, but peculiar to
themselves they have their <i>Bronchia</i>, or the
Branches of the Wind-pipe, for bringing-in
and carrying-out Air so necessary to Life,
that we cannot Live without it: And when
we consider their admirable Structure, (as
well as the Structure of every individual
part of our Body) how ought we to adore
the infinite Wisdom of our Creator! Now
when these small Vesicles or Bladders are
replete with extravasated <i>Serum</i>, or purulent
Matter, the natural Tone of the <i>Lungs</i>
is so weakned, that we cannot enjoy the
Benefit of free and full Respiration, hard,
scirrhous Tumours and Tubercles are bred,
attended with a dry and troublesome Cough,
Oppression of the Breast, difficult and short
Breathing, preternatural Heats, Exulcerations,
and other deplorable Symptoms,
according to the Degrees of Obstruction,
and different Nature of the included Humours.</p>

<p>IV. The external Procatartic Cause of a
<i>Consumption</i> of the <i>Lungs</i> is cold Particles
of Air, constipating the Pores of the Body,
whereby the <i>Serum</i> which ought to expedite
the Motion, and temperate the Heat of
the Blood is separated from it, and thrown
upon the Glands of the <i>Larynx</i>, and the
spungy Substance of the Lungs themselves:
For as the <i>Lympha</i> helps the Motion of the
<i>Chyle</i>, so the <i>Serum</i> accelerates the Circulation
of the Blood, being carried about with
it thro’ the smallest Capillary Vessels and
remotest parts of the Body, lest it should
be inflamed with a burning Heat, or stagnate
by excessive Thickness; during which
circular Motion they are both called by the
same common Name, but when some Portion
of <i>Serum</i> is separated from the Mass of
Blood, and retreats to some one or more of
the Emunctories; according to their various
Dispositions, it derives a Name from those
particular Parts on which it seizeth, as when
it distils upon the Eyes, we call it <i>Opthalmia</i>,
when upon the Nose <i>Coryza</i>, and
when upon the <i>Thorax</i> it goes by the proper
Name of a <i>Catarrh</i>.</p>

<p>Now forasmuch as there is nothing
makes a Separation of the Blood more
commonly than the want of usual Transpiration,
so nothing more conduceth to the
Preservation of Health, than that the
Pores of the Body should continually let out
the hot Streams and Vapours that arise from
the Ebullition of the Blood; but when
after taking Cold the Skin and Habit of the
Body are on a sudden stopped up, that
the sulphureous and waterish Excrements of
the Blood cannot pass through the Pores,
they are again resorbed into the Mass of
Blood, from whence proceeds a feverish
Disposition; unless they are carried off by
Stool, or precipitated by the Kidneys, are
sometimes translated to the Glandulous Parts
of the <i>Lungs</i>, where by Degrees contracting
more and more Heat and Sharpness they
inflame and exulcerate these tender Parts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless tho’ a <i>Consumption</i> of the
<i>Lungs</i> is sometimes thus caused by taking
Cold, yet this comes to pass but seldom,
unless in such Bodies whose Mass of Blood
being rendered Cachectic, thro’ frequent Influxes
of dispirited Chyle, is pre-disposed
to receive, and unable to free it self from
this New Influx of Catarrhous Rheum:
For suppose Two Persons in like manner
deprived of the Benefit of usual Transpiration,
by some great Cold, which tho’ troublesome
in the beginning, because of a violent
and continual Distillation of Extravasated
<i>Serum</i> upon the Glandulous Coat of
the Wind-pipe, and other adjacent Glands,
yet in the One of these it survives not the
accidental feverish Disposition of the Blood,
occasioned by the Stoppage of the Pores:
For as soon as the Ferment ceaseth, the
separated Humours, partly for want of a
new Influx of <i>Serum</i>, and partly by the
natural Heat of these Parts, are concocted
into a thick sort of Phlegm, and coughed
up; after the Expectoration of which separated
<i>Serum</i> the glandulous Parts presently
recover their natural Tone, without any
Remains of a Tumour, Cough, Shortness
of Breath, or other Inconvenience; but in
the other this feverish Ferment, occasioned
by taking Cold, is not transitory, but so
habitually fixed by means of some previous
Indisposition, as to encrease the Effervescence
and Colliquation of the Blood and
Spirits; from whence all the Glands which
are seated in the upper part of the <i>Larynx</i>,
as also the glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe
it self are overflown with a Deluge of
hot distempered Humours, the Substance of
the <i>Lungs</i> distended with hard Tumours,
the Branches of the Wind-pipe comprest,
and the Wind-pipe it self from these Swellings
irritated to Cough, by a continual tickling,
which promotes a frequent spewing
out of hot sharp Humours all along the
<i>Aspera Arteria</i>, till at length these Tubercles
growing very large, begin to inflame
and suppurate; immediately upon the breaking
or opening of those Apostemes, sometimes
such a Flood of corrupted Matter is
poured out of their Baggs or Cavities, into
the Branches of the <i>Trachea</i>, as compleatly
suffocates and choaks the Patient; but at
other times this Purulent Matter, mixt
with streaks of Blood, and some thin Phlegm
that is continually discharged from the
glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe, is
coughed up by degrees, and then this deplorable
Case requires Specific Medicines, to
cleanse and heal these Ulcers.</p>

<p>V. Such kind of <i>Consumptions</i> whose
Original is store of malignant acrimonious
Humours, which are most apt to inflame
and putrify, may be termed acute, when
compared to others that proceed from Humours
more mild and benign. There may
be likewise some difference made by omitting
Bleeding, and committing some egregious
Errors in Diet, Exercise, Passions of
the Mind, or any other of the <i>Non-Naturals</i>:
However, all <i>Consumptions</i> of the
<i>Lungs</i> ought to be reckoned in the Number
of Chronical Distempers, because they are
contracted and augmented by degrees, and
no other way to be remedied; yet this doth
not prove them incurable in their own Nature,
for Reason and Experience both teach
the contrary: And indeed I must confess,
it was from the marvelous Success of these
Remedies that I first imbibed this Notion,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Ulcers</i> of the <i>Lungs</i> are in themselves
curable. Sometimes a Fever or other acute
Distemper may be jugulated, when either
Nature or Art carries off the Morbific Matter
by a sudden <i>Crisis</i> or plentiful Evacuation,
but all hopes of dispatching a confirmed
<i>Consumption</i> of the <i>Lungs</i> instantly
are groundless, seeing many inveterate Obstructions
must be removed, abundance of
tough glutinous Humours attenuated and
evacuated, the whole Mass of Blood and
Spirits rectified, the Habit of the Body meliorated,
and the Tone of several parts recovered,
before we can eradicate this fixed
Distemper.</p>

<p>What will be the Issue and Result of
this <i>Consumptive-Disease</i>, may rationally be
prognosticated from it’s several Stages or
Degrees: For when the Mass of Blood by
a continual Influx of sour dispirited Chyle
is reduced to a sharp and hectical State, and
the <i>Serum</i> which is separated from this corrupted
Blood only stuffs the Bladders and
Glandules which are dispersed thro’ the
Body of the Lungs, this Distemper may
be said to be in it’s Infancy or beginning,
(and if sovereign Remedies were then presented,
they might obtain an easy Conquest)
but the Increase is attended with a greater
Distention of the Glands and Bladders, as
also an Inflammation of these Tubercles
tending to suppuration: For when the Animal
Spirits which are necessary to the natural
Fermentation of the Blood are vitiated
with unwholesome Particles of a foggy and
thick Air, and the Humour which for a
long time hath been contained in the Baggs
or Cavities of the Lungs is over-heated by
some extraordinary Ebullition or Fermentation
of the Blood, with a total Suppression
of Expectoration, the Cough becomes more
violent, the Fever inflammatory, and all
parts more tabid. In it’s further Progress or
State all Symptoms advance apace towards
their Extremity, Suppuration now succeeds
the Inflammation of these Tubercles, for
that the Purulent Matter is either breeding
or already made, the Inflammatory Hectic
is changed into a putrid Intermitting Fever,
attended with an Universal Colliquation of
the Nutritious Juices and plentiful Separation
of them from the Mass of Blood by all
ways of Evacuation that Nature affords;
whence the Patients strength suddainly decays,
and in a short time he is reduced to
the highest State of a <i>Marasmus</i>, with an
<i>Hippocratic</i> Face.</p>

<p>VI. Thus having demonstrated to the
meanest Capacity the Power of this prevailing
Evil, with it’s efficient and material
Causes, Reason it self presently suggests
nothing less than great and noble Medicines
can tame a Distemper so formidable. It is
no less obvious to the Understanding of
every one that professeth any thing of Physic,
that the sooner the Cure is begun the
better, the more moderate the Patient is in
the use of the Six <i>Non-Naturals</i>, the more
likely to succeed; the Spring-time is the
best Season, Universals are to be premised,
extraordinary Symptoms and Circumstances
peculiarly attended, and such like things
must run through the whole Course of
Practice.</p>

<p>No doubt but the Chalibeate Mineral
Waters when impregnated with the Volatile
Salts and Spirits of a serene Air, pleasant
Society, delightful Recreations, Morning
and Evening Walks, regular Diet,
Freedom from Business, vexatious Thoughts,
<span class="nowrap">Exercise<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>, and the rest may be serviceable:
But if the <i>Jesuit</i> were sentenced to perpetual
Exile, I think the Consumptive have
no reason excessively to lament, for I can
tell them who hath a Febrifuge Antihectical,
without a Grain of the <i>Jesuit</i>, more
excellent far than the <i>Peruvian</i> Bark, because
it makes a safe, not a treacherous
Peace, and can give a Reason of it’s working
so stupendiously, tho’ they who know
not how a thing can be done, think it
impossible to be done.</p>

<p>For my part, I do not believe any Medicine
can work a Cure in the way of a
Charm, yet they who either know or use
no other (at least for the most part) than
ordinary Medicines, cannot conceive how
such wonderful Effects can be wrought, unless
by <span class="nowrap">Inchantment<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span>.</p>

<p>The common Method of Cure is by
Bleeding to abate the Effervescence or Colliquation
of the Blood, and prevent the
Tumour and Inflammation of the Lungs,
by Vomits to relieve the Stomach opprest
with store of ill Humours, and remove divers
Obstructions of several Bowels and
small Vessels, by Stomach-Purges gently
to carry down the peccant Humours; and
lastly by Diuretics and Diaphoretics with
some mixture of an Opiate, plentifully to
carry off the Colliquated <i>Serum</i> by Urine,
or the Pores of the Skin, without raising a
fresh Catarrh by a new Commotion of the
Blood. After a due Administration of these
universal Evacuations, (which in their respective
Seasons are highly necessary) the frequent
Use of Pectoral Apozems and Pulmonary
Linctuses is next enjoined, to retund
the Acrimony of the Humours which
ouze out of the Wind-pipe, by their mucilaginous
and incrassating Quality, and so
mitigate the troublesome Cough. How far
serviceable to this end and purpose the neatest
Forms of such Dispensations that I ever
yet saw may be, I will not dispute, only
this I must take leave to say, because to me
(as also to the unprejudiced I humbly conceive)
it seems evident that such fulsom Ingredients
of which they are compounded,
are more apt to spoil a weak than recover
a lost Stomach, and consequently not the
fittest Medicines Consumptive Persons may
have recourse to: For how many by woful
Experience have found the constant and
frequent use of such Anti-Stomachics led
them from one Degree of this Malady to
another, ’till their decaying Appetite hath
been quite overthrown, (and consequently
their hectic Heat inflamed) their Bodies so
emaciated, as to render them uncapable of
necessary Evacuations, and they themselves
at last given over to a Milk Diet, Asses
Milk, some Chalibeate Mineral Waters, or
such like Liquids, to which the poor distressed
Stomach ecchoes aloud, <i>Miserable
Comforters all</i>! If therefore I can, as I
have Reason to believe, with Medicines less
offensive in Quantity, and more useful in
Quality, restore the lost Appetite, and do
the same, if not greater Service towards
the Concocting and Expectorating that load
of separated <i>Serum</i> with which the Pipes
of the Lungs are stuffed, (which will easily
be perceived by the Patient in a few Weeks
with due Care and Management) I think I
have gained a great Point, forasmuch as
the Recovery of the Stomach may reasonably
be looked upon as an Earnest of the
Cure.</p>

<p>The Medicines I do here recommend
to my Countrymen as Specific in the Cure
of <i>Consumption</i> of the <i>Lungs</i>, arising from
the fore-mentioned Causes, have a peculiar
Faculty of warming, comforting and
strengthening weak Stomachs, attenuating
and gently carrying off that load of Tartareous
Matter which is lodged in their rugous
Coat, depraving both Appetite and
Digestion. In their Passage thro’ the whole
Circumference of the Guts, they likewise
dissolve that crusted Slime and Filth which
hinders the Pressure of the Chyle into the
Milky Vessels by the Peristaltic Motion of
their Spiral Fibres: Thus having removed
these Fundamental Obstructions, they hasten
together with the Chylous Mixture, which
by this time is somewhat Invigorated towards
the Relief of the Sanguineous Mass,
presently upon their Conjunction the Blood
revives, and by degrees becomes brisk and
vigorous, able to cope with, and give some
check to the preternatural hectic Heat, stop
the Influx of the Rheum into the Glandulous
Substance of the Lungs, concoct that
which is already collected, and release the
Animal Spirits, intangled with a vitious
disposition of the Nervous Juice. Having
gained these Advantages, things begin to
look with another manner of Aspect, the
Habit of the Body grows firmer, the Mind
chearfuller, the Countenance fresh and
brisk, the emaciated Parts gather Flesh and
Strength, the Lungs and Glands of the
<i>Larynx</i> recover their natural Tone, and the
whole Constitution improves towards a State
of Health. Moreover, These <i>Anti-Phthisics</i>
are really impregnated with such Volatile
Spirits and Salts, that as Lightning they
penetrate the remotest Corners of the Body,
exterminating the very Seeds and Roots of
this grievous Disease, powerfully and effectually,
yet pleasantly and securely, if plentifully
taken in the manner of a Diet: For
thus in time they chear up the drooping
Animal Spirits, fortify the System of the
Nerves, and so influence the whole Sanguineous
Mass, as that the Blood it self becomes
the most precious of all natural Balsoms,
marvellously cleansing the putrid <i>Ulcers</i>
of the <i>Lungs</i>, and finally reducing them
to a perfect <i>Cicatrix</i>.</p>

<p>Wherefore let none be deceived by the
flattering Nature of this Distemper in the
beginning, nor give themselves over for lost
in the highest State, because these reviving
Cordials are calculated for the weakest Constitutions,
seeing at the same time they offend
the Diseased Matter on the one Hand,
they support Nature from sinking under
any Evacuations on the other. It is therefore
my Advice to the <i>Consumptive</i>, or <i>Consumptively-inclined</i>,
and their Interest (by
way of Prevention) to acquaint themselves
in time with these Sovereign Antidotes. Better
Counsel I cannot give to the best of my
Friends, if they are desirous to save themselves
a great deal of Pain and Misery, as
well as Charges, and render their Lives
comfortable to themselves and serviceable to
others.</p>

<p>The Warmness of these Medicines, which
is the only Objection that ever I met with
in the use of them, is so far from being a
real Discouragement, as that upon serious
and judicious Considerations, it becomes a
Notable Argument to enforce the taking of
them; for otherwise they would be too weak
to engage the Original Cause of hectic,
burning and putrid Fevers; whereas by this
active Principle of Heat, they work so effectually
upon the whole Mass of Chyle, as
to separate the sharp and dispirited from the
nutritious Particles thereof, thoroughly insinuate
themselves into all the Avenues of
the Adversary, cut and divide the tough viscous
Humours which distemper the Veins,
Arteries and Nerves, destroy the Acidity of
the Nervous Juice, recover the Natural
Temper of the Animal Spirits, sweeten the
Mass of Blood, by separating the Impurities
thereof by the Cutaneous Glands, gently
forcing a Transpiration of the Feverish Particles
of the whole, and so banish that Preternatural
Heat which is Proof to all common
Remedies. And that Diseases which
carry in their outward Appearance a shew of
preternatural Heat are thus to be treated
with warm Medicines, is indeed observable
to every discerning Eye: For the most malignant
Fevers are attacked and conquered by
the briskest and warmest <i>Alexipharmics</i> and
the most violent <i>Erysipelas</i>, or St <i>Anthony</i>’s
<i>Fire</i>, is discussed and breathed out by strong
and spirituous Fomentations, but are both
of them exasperated by refrigerating or cooling
Medicines, and their preternatural Heat
more and more increased, till the one at
length terminates in the <i>cold sweats of Death</i>,
and the other in a compleat <i>Mortification</i>.</p>

<p>To multiply Encomiums of this kind is
remote from my intended Brevity, therefore
take this remarkable one for all: The
Efficacy of <i>Specific Medicines</i> may be experienced
from Mr <i>Boyle</i>’s unparalelled
Treatise, herein referred to, and from the
full Descriptions I have given any Chymist
of Eminence, upon consulting each respective
Patient’s Case, can effectually prepare
them. But I would more particularly recommend
for this Purpose the Skilful Mr
<i>Boyle Godfrey</i>, in <i>Covent-Garden</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">THE</em> great Pains and Diligence
You have employ’d in the Defence
of Modesty and Virtue, give You
an undisputed Title to the Address of
this Treatise; tho’ it is with the utmost
Concern that I find myself under a Necessity
of writing it, and that after so
much Reforming, there should be any
Thing left to say upon the Subject, besides
congratulating You upon Your
happy Success. It is no small Addition
to my Grief to observe, that Your Endeavours
to suppress Lewdness have
only serv’d to promote it; and that this
<i>Branch</i> of <i>Immorality</i> has <i>grown</i> under
Your Hands, as if it was <i>prun’d</i> instead
of being <i>lopp’d</i>. But however Your
ill Success may grieve, it cannot astonish
me: What else could we hope for,
from Your persecuting of poor strolling
Damsels? From your stopping up those
<i>Drains</i> and <i>Sluices</i> we had to let out
Lewdness? From your demolishing
those <i>Horn-works</i> and <i>Breast-works</i> of
Modesty? Those <i>Ramparts</i> and <i>Ditches</i>
within which the Virtue of our Wives
and Daughters lay so conveniently <i>intrench’d</i>?
An Intrenchment so much the
safer, by how much the Ditches were
harder to be fill’d up. Or what better
could we expect from Your Carting of
Bawds, than that the Great Leviathan
of Leachery, for Want of these Tubs
to play with, should, with one Whisk
of his Tail, overset the <i>Vessel</i> of Modesty?
Which, in her best Trim, we
know to be somewhat <i>leaky</i>, and to have
a very unsteady <i>Helm</i>.</p>

<p>An ancient Philosopher compares
Lewdness to a wild, fiery, and headstrong
young Colt, which can never be
broke till he is rid into a Bog: And
<i>Plato</i>, on the same Subject, has these
Words; <i>The Gods</i>, says he, <i>have given
us one disobedient and unruly Member,
which, like a greedy and ravenous Animal
that wants Food, grows wild and
furious, till having imbib’d the Fruit of
the common Thirst, he has plentifully
besprinkled and bedewed the Bottom of
the Womb</i>.</p>

<p>And now I have mentioned the Philosophers,
I must beg Your Patience for
a Moment, to hear a short Account of
their Amours: For nothing will convince
us of the irresistible Force of
Love, and the Folly of hoping to suppress
it, sooner than reflecting, that those
venerable <i>Sages</i>, those Standards of Morality,
those great <i>Reformers</i> of the
World, were so sensibly touch’d with
this tender Passion.</p>

<p><i>Socrates</i> confess’d, that, in his old
Age, he felt a strange tickling all over
him for five Days, only by a Girl’s
touching his Shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Xenophon</i> made open Profession of
his passionate Love to <i>Clineas</i>.</p>

<p><i>Aristippus</i> of <i>Cyrene</i>, writ a lewd
Book of ancient Delights; he compar’d
a Woman to a House or a Ship, that
was the better for being used: He asserted,
that there was no Crime in Pleasure,
but only in being a Slave to it:
And often used to say, I <i>enjoy</i> Lais, <i>but</i>
Lais <i>does not enjoy me</i>.</p>

<p><i>Theodorus</i> openly maintain’d, that a
wise Man might without Shame or
Scandal, keep Company with common
Harlots.</p>

<p><i>Plato</i>, our great Pattern for chaste-Love,
proposes, as the greatest Reward
for public Service, that he who has perform’d
a signal Exploit, should not be
deny’d any amorous Favour. He writ
a Description of the Loves of his Time,
and several amorous Sonnets upon his
own Minions: His chief Favorites were
<i>Asterus</i>, <i>Dio</i>, <i>Phædrus</i>, and <i>Agatho</i>;
but he had, for Variety, his Female
Darling <i>Archeanassa</i>; and was so noted
for Wantonness, that <i>Antisthenes</i>, gave
him the Nick-name of <i>Satho</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>Well-furnish’d</i>.</p>

<p><i>Polemo</i> was prosecuted by his Wife
for Male-Venery.</p>

<p><i>Crantor</i> made no Secret of his Love
to his Pupil <i>Arcesilaus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Arcesilaus</i> made Love to <i>Demetrius</i>
and <i>Leocharus</i>; the last, he said, he
would fain have open’d: Besides, he
publickly visited the two <i>Elean</i> Courtezans,
<i>Theodota</i> and <i>Philæta</i>, and was
himself enjoy’d by <i>Demochares</i> and
<i>Pythocles</i>: He suffer’d the last, he said,
for Patience-sake.</p>

<p><i>Bion</i> was noted for debauching his
own Scholars.</p>

<p><i>Aristotle</i>, the first <i>Peripatetic</i>, had
a Son call’d <i>Nichomacus</i>, by his Concubine
<i>Herpilis</i>: He lov’d her so well,
that he left her in his Will a Talent of
Silver, and the Choice of his Country-Houses;
that, as he says, the Damsel
might have no Reason to complain: He
enjoy’d, besides the Eunuch <i>Hermias</i>,
others say only his Concubine <i>Pythais</i>,
upon whom he writ a Hymn, call’d,
<i>The Inside</i>.</p>

<p><i>Demetrius Phalereus</i>, who had 360
Statues in <i>Athens</i>, kept <i>Lamia</i> for his
Concubine, and at the same time was
himself enjoy’d by <i>Cleo</i>: He writ a
Treatise, call’d, <i>The Lover</i>, and was
nick-nam’d by the Courtezans, <i>Charito</i>,
<i>Blespharus</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>A Charmer of Ladies</i>;
and <i>Lampetes</i>, i.&nbsp;e. <i>A great Boaster
of his Abilities</i>.</p>

<p><i>Diogenes</i>, the <i>Cynic</i>, us’d to say,
that Women ought to be in common,
and that Marriage was nothing but a
Man’s getting a Woman in the Mind
to be lain with: He often us’d Manual
Venery in the public Market-place,
with this Saying. <i>Oh! that I could
assuage my Hunger thus with rubbing
of my Stomach!</i></p>

<p>But what Wonder if the old <i>Academics</i>,
the <i>Cyrenaics</i>, and <i>Peripatetics</i>,
were so lewdly wanton, when
the very <i>Stoics</i>, who prided themselves
in the Conquest of all their other
Passions, were forc’d to submit to this?</p>

<p><i>Zeno</i>, indeed, the Founder of that
Sect, was remarkable for his Modesty,
because he rarely made Use of Boys,
and took but once an ordinary Maid-Servant
to Bed, that he might not be
thought to hate the Sex; yet, in his
<i>Commonwealth</i>, he was for a Community
of Women; and writ a Treatise,
wherein he regulated the Motions of
getting a Maidenhead, and philosophically
prov’d Action and Reaction to
be equal.</p>

<p><i>Chrysippus</i> and <i>Apollodorus</i> agree
with <i>Zeno</i> in a Community of Women,
and say, that a wise Man may be in
Love with handsome Boys.</p>

<p><i>Erillus</i>, a Scholar of <i>Zeno</i>’s, was a
notorious Debauchee.</p>

<p>I need not mention the <i>Epicureans</i>
who were remarkable for their Obscenity.</p>

<p><i>Epicurus</i> used to make a Pander of
his own Brother; and his Scholar, the
Great <i>Metrodorus</i>, visited all the noted
Courtezans in <i>Athens</i>, and publicly
kept the famous <i>Leontium</i>, his Master’s
<i>Quondam</i> Mistress. Yet, if you will
believe <i>Laertius</i>, he was every Way a
good Man.</p>

<p>But what shall we say of our Favourite
<i>Seneca</i>, who, with all his <i>Morals</i>,
could never acquire the Reputation
of <i>Chastity</i>? He was indeed
somewhat Nice in his Amours, like
the Famous <i>Flora</i>, who was never
enjoy’d by any Thing less than a Dictator
or a Consul; for he scorn’d to
intrigue with any Thing less than the
Empress.</p>

<p>Now, if those Reverend School-Masters
of Antiquity, were so loose in
their Seminals, shall we, of this Age,
set up for Chastity? Have our <i>Oxford
Students</i> more Command of their Passions
than the <i>Stoics</i>? Are our Young
<i>Templars</i> less Amorous than <i>Plato</i>?
Or, is an <i>Officer</i> of the Army less
Ticklish in the Shoulder than <i>Socrates</i>?</p>

<p>But I need not waste any Rhetoric
upon so evident a Truth; for plain
and clear Propositions, like Windows
painted, are only the more Obscure
the more they are adorn’d.</p>

<p>I will now suppose, that you have
given up the Men as Incorrigible;
since You are convinc’d, by Experience,
that even Matrimony is not able
to reclaim them. Marriage, indeed, is
just such a Cure for Lewdness, as a
Surfeit is for Gluttony; it gives a
Man’s Fancy a Distaste to the particular
Dish, but leaves his Palate as Luxurious
as ever: for this Reason we find so
many marry’d Men, that, like <i>Sampson</i>’s
Foxes, only do more Mischief for
having their Tails ty’d. But the
Women, You say, are weaker Vessels,
and You are resolv’d to make them
submit; rightly judging, if You cou’d
make all the Females Modest, it would
put a considerable Stop to Fornication.
It is great Pity, no doubt, so Fine a
Project should Miscarry: And I would
willingly entertain Hopes of seeing
one of these <i>Bridewell</i> Converts. In
the mean Time it would not be amiss,
if You chang’d somewhat your present
Method of Conversion, especially in
the Article of Whipping. It is very
possible, indeed, that leaving a Poor
Girl Penny-less, may put her in a Way
of living Honestly, tho’ the want of
Money was the only Reason of her
living otherwise; and the stripping
of her Naked, may, for aught I know,
contribute to Her Modesty, and put
Her in a State of Innocence; but surely,
<i>Gentlemen</i>, You must all know, that
Flogging has a quite contrary Effect.
This Project of pulling down Bawdy-houses
to prevent Uncleanness, puts
me in Mind of a certain Over-nice
Gentleman, who cou’d never fancy
his Garden look’d sweet, till he had
demolish’d a Bog-house that offended
his Eye in one Corner of it; but it
was not long before every Nose in the
Family was convinc’d of His Mistake.
If Reason fails to Convince, let us
profit by Example: Observe the Policy
of a Modern Butcher, persecuted with
a Swarm of Carnivorous Flies; when
all his Engines and Fly-flaps have
prov’d ineffectual to defend his Stall
against the Greedy Assiduity of those
Carnal Insects, he very Judiciously cuts
off a Fragment, already blown, which
serves to hang up for a Cure; and
thus, by sacrifising a Small Part, already
Tainted, and not worth Keeping,
he wisely secures the Safety of the
Rest. Or, let us go higher for Instruction,
and take Example by the
Grazier, who far from denying his Herd
the Accustom’d Privilege of Rubbing,
when their Sides are Stimulated
with sharp Humours, very Industriously
fixes a Stake in the Center of the Field,
not so much, you may imagine, to
Regale the Salacious Hides of his
Cattle, as to preserve his Young Trees
from Suffering by the Violence of their
Friction.</p>

<p>I could give You more Examples of
this Kind, equally full of Instruction,
but that I’m loth to detain You from
the Perusal of the following Treatise;
and at the same Time Impatient to
have the Honour of Subscribing Myself</p>

<p class="tac fs280 ls02em">PREFACE.</p>


<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">LEST</em> any inquisitive Reader should puzzle
his Brains to find out why this <i>Foundling</i> is
thus clandestinely dropt at his Door, let it suffice
him, that the <i>Midwife</i> of a Printer was unwilling
to help bring it into the World, but upon
that Condition, or a much harder, that of my
openly <i>Fathering</i> it. I could make many other
reasonable Apologies, if requisite: For, besides my
having follow’d the modest Example of several other
pious <i>Authors</i>, such as that of Εικων Βασιλικη, of
the <i>Whole Duty of Man</i>, &amp;c. who have studied rather
their Country’s Publick Good, than their own
Private Fame; I think, I have also play’d the
Politick Part: for should my <i>Off-spring</i> be defective,
why let it fall upon the Parish. On the
other hand, if accidentally it prove hopeful, ’tis
certain I need be at no further Trouble. There
will then be <i>Parents</i> enough ready to own the <i>Babe</i>,
and take it upon themselves. Adoption amongst
the <i>Machiavellian</i> Laws of the <i>Muses</i> is strictly kept
up, and every day put in Practice: How few of
our now bright <i>Noblemen</i> would otherwise have
<i>Wit</i>? How many of our present thriving <i>Poets</i>
would else want a <i>Dinner</i>? ’Tis a vulgar Error to
imagine Men live upon their own Wits, when
generally it is upon others Follies; a Fund that
carries by much the best Interest, and is by far upon
the most certain Security of any: The <i>Exchequer</i>
has been shut up, the <i>Bank</i> has stopt Payment,
<i>South-Sea</i> has been demolish’d, but <i>White’s</i> was
never known to fail; and indeed how should it,
when almost every Wind blows to <i>Dover</i>, or
<i>Holyhead</i>, some fresh <i>Proprietor</i> amply qualified
with sufficient <i>Stock</i>.</p>

<p>I am in some pain for the Event of this <i>Scheme</i>,
hoping the <i>Wicked</i> will find it too Grave, and
fearing the <i>Godly</i> will scarce venture beyond the
Title-Page: And should they, <i>even</i>, I know they’ll
object, ’tis here and there interwoven with too ludicrous
Expressions, not considering that a dry Argument
has occasion for the larding of Gaiety
to make it the better relish and go down. Besides,
finding by the exact Account tack’d to that most
edifying <i>Anti-Heidegger</i> Discourse<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> that eighty
six Thousand Offenders have been lately punish’d,
and that four hundred Thousand religious Books
have been distributed about <i>Gratis</i> (not to mention
the numberless Three-penny Jobs daily publish’d
to no Ends, or Purpose, but the <i>Author</i>’s;)
I say, finding all these Measures have been taken,
and that Lewdness still so much prevails, I thought
it highly proper to try this Experiment, being fully
convinc’d that opposite Methods often take place.
Own, <i>Preferment-Hunter</i>! when sailing on with the
Tide avails nothing, does not tacking about steer
you sometimes into that snug Harbour, an Employment?
Speak <i>Hibernian Stallion</i>! when a meek
fawning Adoration turns to no Account, does not
a pert assuming Arrogance frequently forward, nay,
gain the critical Minute? And say<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> <i>Mesobin!</i></span>
where a Purge fails, is not a Vomit an infallible
<i>Recipe</i> for a Looseness?</p>

<p>To conclude; when my Arguments are impartially
examin’d, I doubt not but my Readers will
join with me, that as long as it is the Nature of
Man (and <i>Naturam expellas furca licet usque recurret</i>)
to have a Salt <i>Itch</i> in the Breeches, the
<i>Brimstone</i> under the Petticoat will be a necessary
Remedy to <i>lay</i> it; and let him be ever so sly in
the Application, it will still be found out: What
avails it then to affect to conceal that which cannot
be concealed, and that which if carried on openly
and above-board, would become only less detrimental,
and of consequence more justifiable?</p>

<p>Be the Success of this Treatise as it happens, the
Good of Mankind is my only Aim; nor am I
less hearty or zealous in the Publick Welfare of my
Country, than that Noble Pattern of Sincerity,
Bishop <i>B&mdash;&mdash;t</i>, who finishes his Preface with the
following Paragraph. <i>And now, O my <span class="nowrap">G&mdash;</span>, the <span class="nowrap">G&mdash;</span>
of my Life, and of all my Mercies, I offer this Work
to Thee, to whose Honour it is chiefly intended; that
thereby I may awaken the World to just Reflections on
their own Errors and Follies, and call on them to
acknowledge thy Providence, to adore it, and ever
to depend on it.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap2"><em class="gesperrt">THERE</em> is nothing more idle, or
shows a greater Affectation of Wit,
than the modern Custom of treating
the most grave Subjects with
Burlesque and Ridicule. The present
Subject of <i>Whoring</i>, was I dispos’d, would
furnish me sufficiently in this kind, and might
possibly, if so handled, excite Mirth in those who
are only capable of such low Impressions. But,
as the chief Design of this Treatise is to
promote the general Welfare and Happiness
of Mankind, I hope to be excus’d, if I make
no farther Attempts to please, than are consistent
with that Design. The Practice of
<i>Whoring</i> has, of late Years, become so universal,
and its Effects so prejudicial to Mankind,
that several Attempts have been made
to put a Stop to it; and a certain <i>Society</i> of
Worthy <i>Gentlemen</i> have undertaken that Affair
with a Zeal truly commendable, tho’
the Success does but too plainly make it appear,
that they were mistaken in their Measures,
and had not rightly consider’d the Nature
of this Evil, which we are all equally
sollicitous to prevent, however we may differ
in our Opinions as to the Manner. And tho’
the Method I intend to propose, of erecting
<i>Publick Stews</i> for that purpose, may seem at
first sight somewhat ludicrous, I shall, nevertheless,
make it appear to be the only Means
we have now left for redressing this Grievance.
As this Redress is the whole Scope
and Design of this Treatise, I hope to be acquitted
of my Design, when I have prov’d
the following Propositions: That <i>publick
Whoring</i> is neither so criminal in itself, nor so
detrimental to the <i>Society</i>, as <i>private Whoring</i>;
and that the encouraging of <i>publick Whoring</i>,
by erecting <i>Stews</i>, will not only prevent
most of the ill Consequences of this Vice, but
even lessen the <i>Practice</i> of <i>Whoring</i> in general,
and reduce it to the narrowest Bounds
which it can possibly be contain’d in. But
before we proceed, it is requisite that we examine
what those mischievous Effects are
which <i>Whoring</i> naturally produces, that we
may the better judge whether or no they
will be prevented by this Scheme.</p>

<p>The greatest Evil that attends this Vice,
or could well befall Mankind, is the Propagation
of that infectious Disease, called the
<i>French-Pox</i>, which in two Centuries, has
made such incredible Havock all over <i>Europe</i>.
In these Kingdoms it so seldom fails to attend
<i>Whoring</i>, now-a-days mistaken for <i>Gallantry</i>
and <i>Politeness</i>, that a hale, robust Constitution
is esteem’d a Mark of Ungentility; and
a healthy young Fellow is look’d upon with
the same View, as if he had spent his Life in
a Cottage. Our Gentlemen of the Army,
whose unsettled way of Life makes it inconvenient
for them to marry, are hereby very
much weaken’d and enervated, and render’d
unfit to undergo such Hardships as are necessary
for defending and supporting the Honour
of their Country: And our Gentry in general
seem to distinguish themselves by an ill State
of Health, in all probability the Effect of this
pernicious Distemper: for the Secrecy which
most People are obliged to in this Disease,
makes the Cure of it often ineffectual; and
tho’ the Infection itself may possibly be remov’d,
yet for want of taking proper Methods,
it generally leaves such an ill Habit of Body as
is not easily recover’d. ’Tis to this we seem
to owe the Rise of that Distemper, the <i>King’s-Evil</i>,
never known till the <i>French Disease</i>
began to prevail here. But what makes this
Mischief the more intolerable, is, that the
Innocent must suffer by it as well as the
Guilty; Men give it to their Wives, Women
to their Husbands, or perhaps their
Children; they to their Nurses, and the Nurses
again to other Children; so that no Age,
Sex, or Condition can be intirely safe from
the Infection.</p>

<p>Another ill Effect of this Vice, is, its making
People profuse, and tempting them to live beyond
what their Circumstances will admit of;
for if once Men suffer their Minds to be led
astray by this unruly Passion, no worldly Consideration
whatever will be able to stop it;
and Wenching as it is very expensive in itself,
without the ordinary Charges of Physic or
Children, often leads Men into a thousand other
Vices to support its Extravagance: Besides, after
the Mind has once got this extravagant
Turn, there naturally follows a Neglect and
Contempt of Business; and Whoring of itself
disposes the Mind to such a sort of Indolence,
as is quite inconsistent with Industry, the main
Support of any, especially a trading, Nation.</p>

<p>The murdering of Bastard Infants is another
Consequence of this Vice, by much
worse than the Vice itself: and tho’ the Law
is justly severe in this Particular, as rightly
judging that a Mind capable of divesting itself
so intirely of Humanity, is not fit to live
in a civiliz’d Nation: yet there are so many
ways of evading it, either by destroying the
Infants before their Birth, or suffering them
afterwards to die by wilful Neglect, that
there appears but little Hope of putting any
Stop to this Practice, which, besides the Barbarity
of it, tends very much to dispeople the
Country. And since the Prosperity of any
Country is allow’d to depend, in a great measure,
on the Number of its Inhabitants, the
<i>Government</i> ought, if it were possible, to prevent
any Whoring at all, as it evidently hinders
the Propagation of the Species: How
many thousand young Men in this Nation
would turn their Thoughts towards Matrimony,
if they were not constantly destroying
that Passion, which is the only Foundation of
it? And tho’ most of them, sooner or later,
find the Inconvenience of this irregular Life,
and think fit to confine themselves to One, yet
their Bodies are so much enervated, by the
untimely or immoderate Increase of this Passion,
together with the Relics of Venereal
Cures, that they beget a most wretched, feeble,
and sickly Offspring: We can attribute it
to nothing else but this, that so many of our
ancient Families of Nobles are of late extinct.</p>

<p>There is one thing more we ought to consider
in this Vice, and that is the Injury it
does to particular Persons and Families; either
by alienating the Affections of Wives
from their Husbands, which often proves prejudicial
to both, and sometimes fatal to whole
Families; or else by debauching the Minds
of young Women, to their utter Ruin and
Destruction: for the Reproach they must undergo,
when a Slip of this nature is discover’d,
prevents their marrying in any Degree
suitable to their Fortune, and by degrees
hardens them to all Sense of Shame; and
when they have once overcome that, the present
View of Interest as well as Pleasure,
sways them to continue in the same Course,
till at length they become common Prostitutes.</p>

<p>These are the several bad Effects of Whoring;
and it is an unhappy Thing, that a
Practice so universal as this is, and always
will be, should be attended with such mischievous
Consequences: But since few or
none of them are the necessary Effects of Whoring,
consider’d in itself, but only proceed
from the Abuse and ill Management of it;
our Business is certainly to regulate this Affair
in such sort as may best prevent these
Mischiefs. And I must here beg pardon of
those worthy <i>Gentlemen</i> of the <i>Society</i>, if I
can’t conceive how the Discouragement they
have given, or rather attempted to give, to
publick Whoring, could possibly have the
desired Effect. If this was a Vice acquired
by Habit or Custom, or depended upon Education,
as most other Vices, there might be
some Hopes of suppressing it; and then it
would, no doubt, be commendable to attack
it, without Distinction, in whatever
Form or Disguise it should appear: But alas!
this violent Love for Women is born and
bred with us; nay, it is absolutely necessary
to our being born at all: And however
some People may pretend, that unlawful Enjoyment
is contrary to the Law of <i>Nature</i>,
this is certain, that Nature never fails to furnish
us largely with this Passion, tho’ she is often
sparing to bestow upon us such a Portion of
Reason and Reflection as is necessary to curb it.</p>

<p>That long Course of Experience which
most of these <i>Gentlemen</i> have had in the
World, and which is of so great Use in other
Cases, may probably occasion their Mistake
in this; for Age is very liable to forget
the violence of youthful Passions, and, consequently,
apt to think them easier curb’d:
whereas if we consider the true Source of Whoring,
and the strong Impulse of Nature that
way, we shall find, it is a Thing not to be
too violently restrain’d; lest, like a Stream
diverted out of its proper Channel, it should
break in and overflow the neighbouring
<i>Inclosures</i>.</p>

<p>History affords us several Instances of this
Truth; I shall mention but one, and that
is of Pope <i>Sixtus</i> the Fifth, who was so
strictly severe in the Execution of Justice, if
such Severity may be call’d Justice, and particularly,
against Offenders of this kind, that he
condemned a young Man to the Galleys, only
for snatching a Kiss of a Damsel in the Street:
yet notwithstanding this his <i>Holiness</i>’s Zeal,
he never attempted once to extirpate Whoring
intirely: But like a true <i>Pastor</i> separated the
clean Sheep from the unclean, and confin’d all
the Courtezans to one Quarter of the City. It is
true, he did attempt to moderate this Vice, and
banish’d as many Courtezans as he thought
exceeded the necessary Number; but he was
soon convinc’d of the Error of his Computation,
for <i>Sodomy</i>, and a thousand other unnatural
Vices sprung up, which forc’d him soon
to recal them, and has left us a remarkable
Instance of the Vanity of such Attempts.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to the Proof of our
Proposition, in the first Part of which, it was
asserted, That publick Whoring is neither so
Criminal in itself, nor so Detrimental to the
<i>Society</i>, as private Whoring.</p>

<p>Publick Whoring consists in lying with a
certain Set of Women, who have shook off
all Pretence to Modesty; and for such a Sum
of Money, more or less, profess themselves
always in a Readiness to be enjoy’d. The
Mischief a Man does in this Case is intirely
to himself; for with respect to the Woman, he
does a laudable Action, in furnishing her
with the Means of Subsistence, in the only, or
at least most innocent way that she is capable
of procuring it. The Damage he does
to himself, is either with regard to his Health,
or the Expence of Money, and may be consider’d
under the same View as Drinking,
with this considerable Advantage, that it
restores us to that cool Exercise of our Reason,
which Drinking tends to deprive us of. Indeed
was there a Probability of a Woman’s
Amendment, and of her gaining a Livelihood
by some honester Method, there might be some
Crime in encouraging her to follow such a
Profession: But the Minds of Women are
observ’d to be so much corrupted by the Loss
of Chastity, or rather by the Reproach they
suffer upon that Loss, that they seldom or never
change that Course of Life for the better;
and if they should, they can never recover
that good Name, which is so absolutely
necessary to their getting a Maintenance in
any honest Way whatever; and that nothing
but meer Necessity obliges them to continue
in that Course, is plain from this, That they
themselves in Reality utterly abhor it: And
indeed there appears nothing in it so very alluring
and bewitching, especially to People
who have that Inclination to Lewdness intirely
extinguish’d, which is the only thing
could possibly make it supportable,</p>

<p>The other Branch of Whoring, viz. <i>Private</i>,
is of much worse Consequence; and a
Man’s Crime in this Case increases in proportion
to the different Degree of Mischief
done, if you consider his Crime with regard
to the <i>Society</i>; for as to personal Guilt, Allowance
ought to be made for the Increase of
Temptation, which is very considerable in
the Case of debauching <i>Married Women</i>;
upon account of the Safety to the Aggressor,
either with Respect to his Health, or the
Charge, and, if that affects him, the Scandal
of having a Bastard. On the other hand,
the Injury done, is very considerable, as such
an Action tends to corrupt a Woman’s Mind,
and destroy that mutual Love and Affection
between Man and Wife, which is so necessary
to both their Happiness. Besides, the Risque
run of a Discovery, which at least ruins a
Woman’s Reputation, and destroys the Husband’s
Quiet; nay, where Virtue does not
intirely give way, if it warps but ever so
little, the Consequence is shockingly fatal:
for tho’ the good Man, suspicious of the
Wife’s Chastity, the Wife of the Gallant’s
Constancy, and the Gallant of the Husband’s
Watchfulness, by being a Check upon each
other, may keep the Gate of Virtue shut; yet
then even all Parties must be attended with a
never-ceasing Misery, nor to be imagin’d, but
by those who too fatally <i>feel it</i>.</p>

<p>The Crime of debauching young <i>Virgins</i>
will appear much greater, if we consider that
there is much more Mischief done, and the
Temptation to do it much lessen’d by the fear
of getting Children; which, in most Circumstances
of Life, does a Man a deal of Prejudice,
and keeps at least three Parts in four of our
sober Youth from gratifying this violent Passion.
Besides, the Methods that are necessary
to be taken, before a Man can have such
an Action in his Power, are in themselves
Criminal; and it shows a certain Baseness of
Mind to persuade a Woman, by a thousand
solemn Vows and Protestations, into such a
good Opinion of you, and Assurance of your
Love to her, that she trusts you with all that
is dear and near to her; and this with no
other View but the Gratification of a present
Passion, which might be otherwise vented,
than at the certain Expence of her Ruin, and
putting her under the Necessity of leading
the Life of a <i>Publick Courtezan</i>.</p>

<p>From this general Consideration of Whoring,
it is evident, that tho’ all the several Species
of it proceed from the same Cause, our
natural Love and Passion for Women, yet
they are very different in their Natures, and
fully as distinct Crimes as those which proceed
from our Love to Money, such as Murder,
Shoplifting, <i>&amp;c.</i> And I hope I have said
enough to prove, that the Publick Part of it
is by far the least Criminal, and least Detrimental
to the <i>Society</i>; which of itself is a sufficient
Motive for the <i>Legislature</i> to confine
it to that Channel. I shall now proceed
farther, and show, as I before propos’d, that
the encouraging of Publick Whoring, will
not only prevent most of the mischievous
Effects of this Vice, but even lessen the Practice
of Whoring in general, and reduce it to
the narrowest Bounds which it can possibly be
contain’d in.</p>

<p>When I talk’d of encouraging publick
Whoring, I would be understood to mean,
not only the erecting <i>Publick Stews</i>, as
I at first hinted, but also the endowing
them with such Privileges and Immunities,
and at the same time giving such Discouragement
to private Whoring, as may be most
effectual to turn the general Stream of Lewdness
into this common Channel.</p>

<p>I shall here lay down a Plan for this Purpose,
which, tho’ it may well serve to illustrate
this Point, and make good the Proof of
my present Argument, would doubtless
receive infinite Improvement by coming
through the Hands of a <i>National Senate</i>,
whose august Body, being compos’d of <i>Spirituals</i>
as well as <i>Temporals</i>, will, I hope, take
into Consideration this Important Affair, which
so nearly concerns both.</p>

<p>The Plan I would propose, is this: Let a
hundred or more Houses be provided in some
convenient Quarter of the City, and proportionably
in every Country-Town, sufficient
to contain two thousand Women: If a hundred
are thought sufficient, let a hundred
<i>Matrons</i> be appointed, one to each House, of
Abilities and Experience enough to take upon
them the Management of twenty Courtezans
each, to see that they keep themselves neat
and decent, and entertain Gentlemen after a
civil and obliging Manner. For the encouragement
of such <i>Matrons</i>, each House must
be allow’d a certain Quantity of all sorts of
Liquor, Custom and Excise free; by which
Means they will be enabled to accommodate
Gentlemen handsomely, without that Imposition
so frequently met with in such Houses.
Besides the hundred abovemention’d, there
must be a very large House set apart for an
Infirmary, and Provision made for two able
Physicians, and four Surgeons at least. Lastly,
there must be three Commissioners appointed
to superintend the whole, to hear and
redress Complaints, and to see that each
House punctually observes such Rules and Orders
as shall be thought necessary for the
good Government of this Community. For
the better Entertainment of all Ranks and
Degrees of Gentlemen, we shall divide the
twenty Women of each House into four Classes,
who for their Beauty, or other Qualifications
may justly challenge different Prices.</p>

<p>The first Class is to consist of eight, who
may legally demand from each Visitant Half
a Crown. The second Class to consist of six,
whose fix’d Price may be a Crown. The third
Class of four, at half a Guinea each. The remaining
two make up the fourth Class, and are
design’d for Persons of the first Rank, who can
afford to pay a Guinea for the Elegancy of their
Taste. To defray the Charges of this Establishment,
will require but a very moderate
Tax: For if the first Class pays but forty
Shillings Yearly, and the rest in Proportion,
it will amount to above 10,000 <i>l.</i>
a Year, which will not only pay the Commissioners
Salaries, Surgeons Chests, and other
Contingencies, but likewise establish a good
Fund for the Maintenance of Illegitimate Orphans
and superannuated Courtezans.</p>

<p>For the better Government of this <i>Society</i>,
it will be necessary that the Mistress have an
absolute Command in her own House, and
that no Woman be suffer’d to go abroad
without her Leave. No Woman must be
suffer’d to lie in, within the House; nor any
young Children admitted under any Pretence.
No Musick or Revelling to be allow’d in any
Room, to the Disturbance of the rest. No
Gentlemen disorderly or drunk, to be admitted
at an unseasonable Hour, without the
Consent of the Mistress: And, in case of Violence,
she must be empower’d to call the Civil
Aid.</p>

<p>For the <i>Society</i>’s Security in Point of Health,
it must be order’d, That if any Gentleman
complains of receiving an Injury, and the
Woman, upon Search, be found tainted, without
having discover’d it to the Mistress, she
shall be stripp’d and cashier’d. But if a Woman
discovers her Misfortune before any Complaint
is made against her, she shall be sent
to the <i>Infirmary</i>, and cured at the Publick
Charge. No Woman that has been twice pox’d
shall ever be re-admitted. <i>Note</i>, That three
Claps shall be reckon’d equivalent to one Pox.</p>

<p>But as no <i>Society</i> ever fram’d a compleat
Body of Laws at once, till overseen Accidents
had taught them Foresight, we shall
refer the farther Regulation of these Laws,
with whatever new ones shall be thought
necessary, to the <i>Wisdom</i> of the <i>Legislature</i>,</p>

<p>The <i>Publick Stews</i> being thus erected and
govern’d by good and wholesome Laws, there
remains nothing to compleat this Project, but
that proper Measures be taken effectually to
discourage all other Kinds of Whoring whatsoever.
And here it is to be hoped, that those
worthy <i>Gentlemen</i> of the <i>Society</i>, who have
hitherto distinguish’d their <i>Zeal</i> to so little
Purpose, will now exert themselves where
they have so good a Prospect of Success; for
altho’ a poor Itinerant Courtezan could not
by any Means be persuaded to starve at the
Instigation of a <i>Reforming</i> Constable, yet a
little <i>Bridewell</i> Rhetorick, or the Terrors of
a Transportation, will soon convince her that
she may live more comfortably and honestly in
a <i>Publick Stew</i>. If there are any so foolish as
to love Rambling better, or who are not qualify’d
to please Gentlemen according to Law,
they ought to be transported; for <i>Bridewell</i>,
as it is now manag’d, only makes them poorer,
and consequently lays them under a greater
Necessity than ever of continuing Prostitutes.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose, for Brevity sake,
that the <i>Publick Stews</i> are as much as
possible favour’d and encourag’d, and that
all the other Branches of this Vice have the
utmost Rigour of the Laws exerted against
them.</p>

<p>It now remains for me to show what Benefit
the <i>Nation</i> would receive thereby,
and how this Project would prevent or in
any Degree alleviate those Mischiefs which
I have mention’d to be the necessary Consequences
of this Vice. As for any Objections
that may be rais’d against me, either <i>Christian</i>
or <i>Moral</i>, I shall refer them to the Close
of this Discourse.</p>

<p>First then, I say, the <i>Nation</i> would receive
a general Benefit by having such a considerable
Number of its most disorderly Inhabitants
brought to live after a regular
civiliz’d Manner. There is, one Year with
another, a certain Number of young Women
who arrive gradually, Step by Step, at the highest
Degree of Impudence and Lewdness. These
Women, besides their Incontinence, are commonly
guilty of almost the whole Catalogue of
immoral Actions: The Reason is evident;
They are utterly abandon’d by their Parents,
and thereby reduc’d to the last Degree
of Shifting-Poverty; if their Lewdness
cannot supply their Wants, they must have
Recourse to Methods more criminal, such as
<i>Lying</i>, <i>Cheating</i>, <i>open Theft</i>, &amp;c. Not that
these are the necessary Concomitants of Lewdness,
or have the least Relation to it, as all
<i>lewd Men of Honour</i> can testify; but the
Treatment such Women meet with in the
World, is the Occasion of it.</p>

<p>Those Females, who either by the Frigidity
of their Constitutions, a lucky Want of
Temptation, or any other Cause, have preserv’d
their Chastity; and the Men, in general,
Chaste or Unchaste, are so outrageous
against these Delinquents, that they make
no Distinction: all of them are branded
with the same opprobrious Title, they are
all treated with the same Contempt, all
equally despis’d; so that let them be guilty
of what other Crimes they please, they
cannot add one Jot to the Shame they already
undergo. Having thus remov’d the Fear of
worldly Reproach, which is justly esteem’d
the greatest <i>Bulwark</i> of <i>Morality</i>, it is no
wonder if these Women, insensible of Shame,
and prick’d on by Want, commit any Crimes,
where they are not deter’d by the Fear of
corporal Punishments. But the Case now
will be quite alter’d; these Women, as soon
as they have attain’d a competent Share of
Assurance, and before they are pinch’d with
the Extreme of Poverty, will enter themselves
in some of the abovementioned Classes
of profess’d Courtezans; where, instead of
being necessarily dishonest, they will have
more Inducements to Honesty than any other
Profession whatsoever. The same Money
defends, as well as it corrupts a <i>Prime
Minister</i>: A <i>Churchman</i> takes Sanctuary
in a Gown, and who dare accuse a Mitre
of <i>Simony</i>? Accuse a <i>Colonel</i> of Injustice,
he is try’d by his Board of <i>Officers</i>, and your
Information is false, scandalous, and malicious.
A <i>Lawyer</i> cheats you according to
Law; and you may thank the <i>Physician</i>, if
you live to complain of him. <i>Over-reaching</i>
in Trade, is <i>prudent Dealing</i>; and <i>Mechanick
Cunning</i>, is stiled <i>Handicraft</i>. Not
so fares the poor Courtezan; if she commits
but one ill Action, if, for Instance, she
should circumvent a Gentleman of a <i>Snuff-Box</i>,
she can hardly escape Detection; and
the first Discovery ruins her; she is banish’d
the <i>Publick Stews</i>, mark’d out for Infamy,
and can have no better Prospect than a Transportation.
On the other hand, the Motives
to Honesty will be as great here as any
where: It is natural for Mankind to regard
chiefly the good Opinion of those with whom
they converse, and to neglect that of Strangers:
Now in this Community, Lewdness
not being esteem’d a Reproach, but rather a
Commendation, they will set a Value on
their good Name, and stand as much upon
the Puncto of Honour, as the rest of Mankind;
being mov’d by the same commendable
Emulation, and deter’d by greater, or
at least more certain Punishments. Besides
this Reformation in Point of Honesty, the
Publick will receive another Benefit in being
freed from those nocturnal Disorders, Quarrels
and Brawlings, which are occasion’d
by vagrant Punks, and the Number of private
Brothels dispers’d throughout the City,
to the great Disturbance of its sober Inhabitants.</p>

<p>We have already mention’d the <i>French
Disease</i> as one of the worst Attendants upon
Lewdness, and with good Reason; for in
the Enjoyment of this Life, Health is the
<i>sine qua non</i>: <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the greatest Happiness. And
this Distemper has one Thing in it peculiarly
inveterate, as if it came out of <i>Pandora’s</i> worst
Box; there is no other Disorder, but what at
some Age, or in some particular Constitution,
will abate of itself without the Application of
Medicines; but this is such a busy restless Enemy,
that unless resisted, he is never at a
Stand, but gathers Strength every Day, to
the utter Disquiet of the Patient. Now it is
so evident that the <i>Publick Stews</i>, when
well regulated, will prevent the Spreading
of this Plague, that a prolix and tedious
Proof of it would look like Declaiming.
As this Disease has its Spring and Source entirely
from publick Whoring, and from
thence creeps into private Families; so it
likewise receives continual Supplies and Recruits
thro’ the same Channel: When this
Source is once dry’d up the Nation will naturally
recover its pristine Health and Vigour:
And this cannot fail to happen, if
due Care be taken to keep the <i>Stews</i> free
from Infection; for what young Fellow
will be so industriously mad, as to take
Pains to run his Head into an Apothecary’s
Shop, when he may with so much Ease
and Conveniency, and without the Fear
of a <i>Reforming Officer</i>, both secure his
Health and gratify his Fancy with such a
Variety of Mistresses.</p>

<p>’Tis true, the keeping of the <i>Publick
Stews</i> so very safe, will appear a difficult
Task, at first Sight; but not so if we consider
the Case a little nearer. This Disease
is propagated reciprocally from the Woman
to the Man, and from the Man to the
Woman; but the first is the most common
for several Reasons: We are not like Cocks
or Town-Bulls, who have a whole Seraglia
of Females entirely and solely at their Devotion;
on the contrary, one industrious
Pains-taking Woman, who lays herself out
that Way, is capable of satisfying several
rampant Males; insomuch, that a select
Number of Women get a handsome Livelihood
by being able to oblige such a Number
of Customers. Now, if but a few of
these Women are unsound, they can infect
a great many Men; whereas these Men
have neither Power nor Inclination to infect
the like Number of Women. I say, Inclination;
for a Woman, to raise Money
for the Surgeon’s Fee, may counterfeit Pleasure
when she really receives Pain; nay, she
may even venture to complain of being hurt:
for the Man will attribute the Pain he gives
her, either to her Chastity, or his own Vigour;
not dreaming, perhaps, that he has
molested a <i>Shanker</i>. This a Female may
do, as being only passive in the Affair,
but a Man must have real Fancy and Inclination
before he is qualify’d to enter upon
Action: And how far this Fancy to
Woman may be cool’d by a stinging <i>Gonorrhœa</i>,
I leave the experienc’d Reader to
judge; and whether a Man won’t rather
employ his Thoughts upon his <i>round Diet</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
Pills, how to digest 2 at Night, and 3 in
the Morning; what Conveyance to find
out when poach’d Eggs grow nauseous,
and how to preserve his Linnen from being
speckled; with a Thousand other Particulars
that occur to a Man in this Distress: but
these are sufficient, with the Assistance of
a <i>Cordee</i>, to <i>bridle</i> any moderate Passion.
So that from the whole we may safely draw
this Conclusion; That since the Men are
so seldom guilty of transgressing in this Kind,
the spreading of this Distemper must be
owing to the Neglect of Cure in the Women.
Now the <i>Publick Stews</i> will be so
regulated, that a Woman cannot possibly
conceal her Misfortune long; nay, it will
be highly her Interest to make the first
Discovery; so that whatever Damage the <i>Society</i>
may sustain at first, when Claps are
most current, it will be soon repair’d, and this
Distemper, in Time, entirely rooted out. But
of this enough.</p>

<p class="mt2em">The next Thing that comes to be consider’d
in this Vice, is the Expence it occasions,
and the Neglect of worldly Business,
by employing so much of our Time and
Thoughts; for let a Man have ever so much
Business, it can’t stop the Circulation of his
Blood, or prevent the Seminal Secretion:
for Sleeping or Waking, the <i>Spermaticks</i>
will do their Office, tho’ a Man’s Thoughts
may be so much employ’d about other
Affairs, that he cannot attend to every minute
Titillation. A Man of Pleasure, indeed,
may make this copulative Science his
whole Study; and, by Idleness and Luxury,
may prompt Nature that Way, and spur up
the Spirits to Wantonness: but then his
Constitution will be the sooner tired; for
the Animal Spirits being exhausted by this
Anticipation, his Body must be weaken’d,
and his Nerves relax’d; neither will his irregular
effeminate Life assist them in recovering
their former Force. Besides, those Parts
which more particularly suffer the Violence
of this Exercise, are liable to many Accidents;
and Men of Pleasure, though otherwise
pretty healthy, are often troubled with
Gleets and Weaknesses, either by a former
Ulceration of the <i>Prostrates</i>, or else some
violent Over-straining, which occasions this
Relaxation. These Men, ’tis true, will talk
very lusciously of Women; but, pretend
what they please, they can never have
that burning Desire which they had formerly,
when their Vessels were in full Vigour.
The Truth is, their Lust lies chiefly
in their Brain, kept alive by the Impression
of former Ideas, which are not so easily
rubb’d out as the Titillation which created
them; and this Passion comes to be so diminished,
that, in Time, it changes its Residence
from the <i>Glans Penis</i> to the <i>Glandula
Penealis</i>. A Man of Business, on
the contrary, or one who leads a sober regular
Life, will seldomer be attack’d by
these wanton Fits, but then they will come
with double the Violence; for though it is a
common received Opinion, that the longer
a Man refrains, the better he is able to
refrain, yet it is only true in one Sense,
and amounts to no more than this: That
if a Man has been able, for such and such
Reasons, to curb this Passion, for Instance,
a Month, he will, if the same Reasons hold,
and without an additional Temptation, be
able to curb it a Month longer; but, nevertheless,
he may have Desires much stronger
than a Man who, for want of these
Motives to Abstinence, gratifies them every
Day. If there are some Men of a particular
Constitution, whose puny Desires may
be easily block’d up with the Assistance
of <i>three small Buttons</i>: or else endow’d
with such an extraordinary Strength of Reason,
that they can master the most <i>rampant</i>
Sallies of this raging Passion; I heartily
congratulate their happy Conquest, but
have nothing more to do with them at
present, the <i>Publick Stews</i> not being design’d
for such: I am here speaking of those
Men of Business, who, notwithstanding their
Abstinence or the Regularity of their Lives,
are sometimes prevailed upon to quench these
amorous Heats; and, I say, in such Men the
Passion is much stronger than in Men of
Pleasure, and that their Abstinence contributes
to heighten the Violence of the Desire,
and make it the more irresistible:
for the Fancy not being cloy’d with too
frequent Enjoyment, presently takes fire; and
the <i>Spermaticks</i>, not being weaken’d with
forc’d Evacuations, are in their full Vigour,
and give the Nerves a most exquisite Sensation:
so that upon the least toying with
an alluring Wench, the Blood-Vessels are
ready to start; and to use <i>Othello</i>’s Words,
<i>The very Sense aches at her.</i></p>

<p>Now, what shall this Man do, when he
has once taken the Resolution to make himself
easy? He must either venture upon the
Publick, where, it is Odds, he may meet
with a Mischance that will either drain his
Pocket, and make him unfit for any Business,
at least without Doors; or else he must
employ both his Time and Rhetoric, and
perhaps too his Purse, in deluding some modest
Girl; which, besides the Loss of Time
in carrying on such an Intrigue, is apt to give
the Head such an amorous Turn as is quite
inconsistent with Business, and may probably
lead a Man into After-Expences, which at first
he never dreamt of.</p>

<p>Now to remedy all these Inconveniences,
the <i>Publick Stews</i> will be always ready
and open, where a Man may regulate his
Expences according to his Ability, from
Half a Crown to a Guinea; and that too
without endangering his Health: And besides,
which is chiefly to be consider’d, if
a Man should be overtaken with a sudden
Gust of Lechery, it will be no Hindrance
to him even in the greatest Hurry of Business,
for a ready and willing Mistress will
ease him in the twinkling of an Eye, and
he may prosecute his Affairs with more Attention
than ever, by having his Mind entirely
freed and disengag’d from those troublesome
Ideas which always accompany a
wanton Disposition of the Body. But to proceed:</p>

<p>Another ill Consequence of Whoring, is
the Tendency it has to dispeople a Nation;
and that both by the Destruction of Illegitimate
Infants, and by ruining young Men’s Constitutions
so much, that, when they marry,
they either beget no Children, or such as are
sickly and short-liv’d. The first of these,
indeed, is almost unavoidable, especially in
modest Women, who will be guilty of this
Cruelty as long as Female Chastity carries
that high Reputation along with it, which
it really deserves: However, in common
Women, it may and will be, in a great
measure, prevented by this Scheme; for
every profess’d Courtezan, that is legally
licens’d, will have an Apartment allotted
her in the Infirmary when she is ready to
lie in, and will be obliged to take Care of
her Child; by which means a considerable
Number of Infants will be reared up, that
otherwise might probably have perish’d. Besides,
there are a great many ordinary Girls,
such as Servant-Maids, who are chiefly mov’d
to this Action, by the fear of losing their
Services, and wanting Bread. Now this
handsome Provision that is made for them,
will be a great Inducement for such to enter
themselves in the <i>Stews</i>, rather than commit
such an unnatural Action, especially when the
Discovery is Death.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the Affair of Matrimony.
Since the World is now no longer
in a State of Nature, but form’d into several
Societies independent of one another, and
these Societies again divided into several
Ranks and Degrees of Men, distinguish’d
by their Titles and Possessions, which descend
from Father to Son; it is very certain
that Marriage is absolutely necessary, not only
for the regular Propagation of the <i>Species</i>,
and their careful Education, but likewise
for preserving that Distinction of Rank
among Mankind, which otherwise would be
utterly lost and confounded by doubtful Successions.
And it is no less certain and indisputable,
that all Sorts and Kinds of Debauchery
whatever are Enemies to this State, in
so far as they impair the natural Vigour of
the Constitution, and weaken the very Springs
of Love.</p>

<p>This necessary Passion is, indeed, of such
a ticklish Nature, that either too much or
too little of it is equally prejudicial, and
the <i>Medium</i> is so hard to hit, that we are
apt to fall into one of the Extremes. We
are naturally <i>furnish</i>’d with an extraordinary
<i>Stock</i> of Love; and, by the <i>Largeness</i> of
the Provision, it looks as if Nature had
made some Allowance for <i>Wear and Tear</i>.
If young Men were to live intirely chaste
and sober, without blunting the Edge of
their Passions, the first Fit of Love would
turn their Brains Topsy-turvy, and we should
have the Nation pestered with Love-Adventures
and Feats of Chivalry: By the
time a <i>Peer’s</i> Son came to be Sixteen, he
would be in danger of turning Knight-Errant,
and might possibly take a Cobler’s
Daughter for his <i>Dulcinea</i>; and who knows
but a sprightly young <i>Taylor</i> might turn
an <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, and venture his Neck
to carry off a Lady of Birth and Fortune.
In short, there are so many Instances every
day of these ruinous disproportion’d Matches,
notwithstanding our present Intemperance,
that we may justly conclude, if the
Nation was in a State of perfect Sobriety,
no Man could answer for the Conduct of his
Children.</p>

<p>It must, indeed, be confess’d, as Matters
now stand, the Excess of Chastity is not so
much to be fear’d as the other Extreme of
Lewdness, tho’ there are Instances of both;
and many Fathers, now living, would gladly
have seen their Sons fifty times in a
<i>Stew</i>, rather than see them so unfortunately
married. The other Extreme is equally, or
rather more dangerous, as it is more common;
for most young Men give too great a
Loose to their Passions, and either quite destroy
their Inclination to Matrimony, or
make their Constitutions incapable of answering
the Ends of that State.</p>

<p>To avoid therefore these two dangerous
Extremes, we have erected the <i>Publick
Stews</i>, which every considerate Man must
allow to be that Golden Mean so much desired:
For, in the first Place, we avoid the
Inconvenience of too strict a Chastity.
When a Man has gained some Experience
by his Commerce in the <i>Stews</i>, he is
able to form a pretty good comparative
Judgment of what he may expect from
the highest Gratifications of Love; he finds
his Ideas of Beauty strangely alter’d after
Enjoyment, and will not be hurry’d into
an unsuitable Match by those romantick chimerical
Notions of Love, which possess the
Minds of unexperienced Youth, and make
them fancy that Love alone can compleat
the Happiness of a married State. But this
will be so readily granted, that I shan’t insist
upon it farther.</p>

<p>In the next Place, the <i>Publick Stews</i> will
prevent the ill Effects of excessive Lewdness,
by preserving Men’s Constitutions so well,
that although they may defer Matrimony
some time for their special Advantage, yet
they will have a sufficient Stock of Desire
left to perswade them, one time or other, to
quit the Gaiety of a Single Life: and when
they do marry, they will be able to answer
all the Ends and Purposes of that State as
well, and rather better, than if they had lived
perfectly chaste.</p>

<p>This may seem a bold Proposition, but
the Proof of it is nevertheless obvious. However,
to proceed methodically, there are
three Ways by which lewd young Men destroy
their natural Vigour, and render themselves
Impotent: First, By Manufriction,
<i>alias</i> Masturbation. Secondly, By too frequent
and immoderate Enjoyment. And,
Lastly, By contracting Venereal Disorders,
as Claps or Poxes.</p>

<p>The first lewd Trick that Boys learn, is
this Manual Diversion; and when they have
once got the knack of it, they seldom quit
it till they come to have actual Commerce
with Women: The Safety, Privacy, Convenience,
and Cheapness of this Gratification
are very strong Motives, and chiefly
persuade young Men to continue the Practice
of it.</p>

<p>If these Pollutionists were so abstemious as
to wait the ordinary Calls of Nature, this
Action, however unnatural, would be no
more prejudicial, when prudently managed,
than common Copulation; but, instead of
this, they are every Day committing <i>Rapes</i>
upon their own Bodies; and though they
have neither real Inclination nor Ability to
attack a Woman, yet they can attack themselves,
and supply all these Defects by the
Agility of their Wrists; by which means
they so weaken their Genitals, and accustom
them to this violent Friction, that,
tho’ they have frequently Evacuations without
an Erection, yet the common and ordinary
Sensation which Females afford to
those Parts, is not able of itself to promote
this Evacuation: so that they are impotent
to all Intents and Purposes of Generation.</p>

<p>To put a Stop therefore to these clandestine
Practices, and prevent young Men from
laying <i>violent Hands</i> upon themselves, we
must have Recourse to the <i>Publick Stews</i>,
which cannot fail to have the desired Effect:
For which of these private Practitioners
can be so brutish, as to prefer this boyish
solitary Amusement before the actual Embraces
of a fine Woman, when they can
proceed with the same Convenience, Safety,
and Privacy in the one, as well as the
other.</p>

<p>In the next Place, Men are often weaken’d,
and sometimes contract almost incurable
Gleets by too frequent and immoderate
Enjoyment. This seldom or never
happens but in private Whoring, when some
particular Mistress has made such a strong
Impression upon a Man’s Fancy, that he
exerts himself in an extraordinary Manner
beyond his natural Ability, and thereby
contracts a Seminal Weakness, which is
generally more difficult to cure than a virulent
Running. Now this Danger will
be pretty well remov’d by the Encouragement
given to <i>Publick Whoring</i>, which, as
I shall show more particularly hereafter,
will divert Men’s Minds, and turn their
Thoughts very much from private Intrigues:
And it will be readily granted me, that no
such Excess is to be fear’d in <i>Publick Stews</i>;
where a Man only acting out of a general
Principle of Love to the whole Sex,
will be in no Danger of proceeding any
farther than he is prompted by Nature, and
the particular Disposition of his Body at
that Time.</p>

<p>As for the third Cause of Impotency,
the Venereal Disease, we have already
prov’d that this Institution of the <i>Stews</i>
is the best and surest Remedy against it;
and shall only observe here how happily
this Project provides against the various ill
Effects of Lewdness, in whatever Light we
consider them.</p>

<p>Thus, I think, the first Part of my Proposition
pretty well clear’d, <i>viz.</i> That the
<i>Publick Stews</i> will preserve Mens Constitutions
so well, that they will have a
sufficient Stock of corporal Ability, and consequently
Inclination left to persuade them,
sooner or later, to enter into the Marriage-State.</p>

<p class="mt2em">I say farther, that these Men, having thus
preserv’d their Constitution, will answer all
the Intents and Purposes of that State, rather
better than if they had lived perfectly
chaste.</p>

<p>When a Man and a Woman select one
another out of the whole Species, it is
not merely for Propagation; nay, that is
generally the least in their Thoughts: What
they chiefly have in View, is to pass the
Remainder of their Lives happily together,
to enjoy the soft Embraces and mutual
Endearments of Love; to divide their Joys
and Griefs; to share their Pleasures and
Afflictions; and, in short, to make one
another as happy as possible. As for Children,
they come of Course, and of Course
are educated according to their Parents
Abilities.</p>

<p>Now all these Enjoyments depending
upon the mutual Affection of these two,
Man and Wife; whenever this Affection
fails, either in the Woman or the Man,
that Marriage is unhappy, and all the good
Ends and Designs of this State entirely
frustrated. To give the Women their Due,
they must have the Preference in Point of
Constancy; their Passions are not so easily
rais’d, nor so suddenly fix’d upon any particular
Object: but when this Passion is
once rooted in Women, it is much stronger
and more durable than in Men, and rather
increases than diminishes, by enjoying the
Person beloved. Whether it is that Women
receive as much Love as they part
with, and that the Love they receive is
not entirely lost, but takes Root again by
Conception; whereas what a Man parts
with never affects him further, than just the
Pleasure he receives at the time of parting
with it: or whether this Difference is
owing to the different Turn of Mens Fancies,
which are more susceptible of fresh
Impressions from every handsome Face they
meet, or perhaps that their Heads are so
much employ’d in worldly Affairs, that
they only take Love <i>en passant</i> to get rid
of a present Uneasiness, whereas Women
make it the whole Business of their Lives:
Whatever the Reason is, I say, it is experimentally
true, that a Woman has but a very
<i>slippery Hold</i> of a Man’s Affections after
Enjoyment. Let us see therefore which of
these two, the chaste or the experienc’d Man,
will be least liable to this Failure of Affection,
and consequently which of the two
will make the best married Man.</p>

<p>The first great Cooler of a Man’s Affections
after Marriage, is the Disparity of the
Match. When a Man has married entirely
for Love, and to the apparent Detriment
of his worldly Affairs, as soon as the first
Flash of it is over, he can’t help reflecting
upon the Woman as the Cause, and, in
some Sense, the Author of his Misfortunes;
This naturally begets a Coldness and Indifference,
which, by Degrees, turns to an
open Dislike. Now it is these sorts of Marriages
that chaste Men are always in danger
of falling into, as I have already proved;
neither is there any effectual Way to convince
a Man of this Folly, and secure him
against it, but by giving him some Experience
in Love-Affairs. Again, as chaste
Men seldom marry for any thing but sheer
Love, so they have framed to themselves
such high extravagant Notions of the Raptures
they expect to possess in the Marriage-Bed,
that they are mightily shocked at
the Disappointment. A chaste unexperienc’d
Man is strangely surprized, that those bewitching
Charms should make such a faint
Impression upon him after a thorow Perusal;
he can scarce believe that the Woman is still
possessed of the same Charms which transported
him formerly; he fancies he has discover’d
abundance of little Faults and Imperfections,
and attributes his growing Dislike
to this Discovery, not dreaming that
this Alteration is entirely in himself, and
not in the Object of Desire, which remains
still the same. The Truth is, when a Man is
full fraught with Love, and that his Pulse
beats high for Enjoyment, this peccant Love-Humour
falls down upon the Eye, which
may be observ’d at such a time to be full
brisk and sparkling: ’Tis then the Beauty
of every Feature is magnified. and <i>Parthenope</i>
is no less than a Goddess. But when
this dazzling Humour is drawn downwards
by a Revulsion, as in the Case of Marriage,
a Man’s Eyes are perfectly open’d;
and though they may look languid, sunk, and
environ’d with blueish Circles, yet he actually
sees much better than before; for <i>Parthenope</i>
will now appear to him a Mortal, such
as she really is, divested of all those false Glosses
and Appearances.</p>

<p>The chaste Man is surprized at this
Change; he is apt to lay the Fault upon the
Woman, and generally fixes his Affections
on some other Female, who, he imagines,
is free from those Faults: then farewel happy
Wedlock. The experienc’d Man, on the
contrary, has try’d several Women; he
finds they all agree in one Particular, and
that after a Storm of Love there always succeeds
a Calm: When he enters into Matrimony,
he is prepar’d against any Disappointments
of that Nature, and is ready to make
Allowance for those Faults and Imperfections
which are inseparable from Human
Kind. This is so true, that Women have
establish’d a Maxim, that Rakes make the
best Husbands; for they are very sensible
how difficult it is to monopolize a Man’s
Affections; that he will have his Curiosity
about those Affairs satisfied one time or
other: And tho’ this Experience is useful
before Marriage, it is very dangerous afterwards.</p>

<p>Besides, to compleat the Happiness of the
Marriage-State, or indeed to make it tolerably
easy, there must be some Agreement
in the Temper, Humour, and Disposition of
the two Parties concern’d. If, for Instance,
the Man can’t endure the Sight of a <i>Metropolis</i>,
and the Woman can’t enjoy herself
out of it; if the Man is grave, serious, and
an Enemy to all jocular Merriment, when
his Wife is a profess’d Lover of Mirth and
Gaiety, these two can never agree: Differences
will arise every Day, and Differences
in Wedlock are as hard to reconcile as those
in Religion: We may guess at the Reason
from a parallel Instance.</p>

<p>After the Revocation of the Edict of
<i>Nantz</i>, several Protestant Gentlemen were
shut up in the <i>Bastile</i> at <i>Paris</i>, where they
liv’d constantly together for a considerable
Time: They made an Observation, during
their Stay there, That whenever the least
Difference or Dispute happen’d amongst them,
it was never reconciled till some time after
their Enlargement; because, said they, altho’
we were Yoke-Fellows in Affliction, yet
never being out of one another’s Company,
our Animosities were always kept up warm,
for want of a little Absence to cool them.
It is the same Case with Matrimony; and
People ought to be particularly careful to
chuse a Wife as nearly of their own Temper
as possible.</p>

<p>Now this Consideration never enters into
the Head of a chaste unexperienc’d Man,
he is so infatuated with personal Love, that
he imagines his whole future Happiness depends
upon the Possession of such a Shape,
or such a Composition of Features; when
he is disappointed in this, how much will it
add to his Chagrin, to find himself yoked
for Life to a Woman whose Temper is quite
opposite to his own, and consequently whose
Satisfaction is quite inconsistent with his?
We may guess the Sequel; separate Beds, separate
Maintenance, and all the whole Train
of Conjugal Misfortunes. In short, let us
consider Matrimony under what View we
please, we shall still find that the experienc’d
Man will make the best Husband, and answer
all the Ends of Marriage much better
than a Man who lives perfectly chaste to his
Wedding-Day.</p>

<p>Thus, we see, by this happy Regulation
of the <i>Publick Stews</i>, that Whoring, instead
of being an Enemy to Matrimony, will advance
and promote the Interest of it as much
as possible.</p>

<p class="mt2em">We come to the last great Point propos’d,
<i>viz</i>. that this Project of the <i>Publick
Stews</i> will prevent, as much a possible, the
debauching of modest Women, and thereby
reduce Whoring to the narrowest Bounds in
which it can possibly be contain’d.</p>

<p>To illustrate this Matter, we must step a
little back to consider the Constitution of
Females, while they are in a State of Innocence;
and when we have taken a View of
the Fortifications which Nature has made to
preserve their Chastity, we shall find out
the Reason why it is so often surrender’d,
and be the better able to provide for its
Defence.</p>

<p>Every Woman, who is capable of Conception,
must have those Parts which officiate
so framed, that they may be able
to perform whatever is necessary at that
Juncture. Now, to have those Parts so
rightly adapted for the Use which Nature
design’d them, it is requisite that they should
have a very quick Sensation, and, upon
the Application of the <i>Male-Organ</i>, afford
the Woman an exquisite Pleasure; for
without this extravagant Pleasure in Fruition,
the recipient Organs could never exert
themselves to promote Conception as
they now do, in such an extraordinary
Manner: The whole <i>Vagina</i>, as one continu’d
<i>Sphincter</i>, contracting and embracing
the <i>Penis</i>, while the <i>Nymphæ</i> and adjacent
Islands have their particular Emissions at
that critical Minute, either as a Vehicle
to lubricate the Passage, or else to incorporate
with the Masculine Injection: Add to
this, that the <i>Fallopian Tubes</i> put themselves
in a proper Posture to receive the impregnating
Fluid, and convey it, as is suppos’d,
to the <i>Ovaria</i>. Now it is hard to imagine,
that so many alert Members, which
can exert themselves in such a lively Manner
on this Occasion, should be at all
other Times in a State of perfect Tranquillity;
for, besides that Experience teaches
us the contrary, this handsome Disposition
would be entirely useless, if Nature had not
provided a prior Titillation, to provoke Women
at first to enter upon Action; and all
our late Discoveries, in Anatomy, can find
out no other Use for the <i>Clitoris</i>, but to
whet the Female Desire by its frequent
Erections; which are, doubtless, as provoking
as those of the <i>Penis</i>, of which it is a
perfect Copy, tho’ in Miniature.</p>

<p>In short, there requires no more to convince
us of the Violence of Female Desire,
when raised to a proper height, but only to
consider, what a terrible Risque a Woman
runs to gratify it. Shame and Poverty
are look’d upon as Trifles, when they
come in Competition with this predominating
Passion. But altho’ it must be allow’d,
that all Women are liable to these
amorous Desires, yet, the Variety of Constitutions
will make a considerable Difference;
for as in some Men the <i>Olfactory</i>, <i>Auditory</i>,
or <i>Optick</i> Nerves, are not so brisk
and lively as in others, so there are some
Women who have the Nerves of their <i>Pudenda</i>
more lively, and endow’d with a
much quicker Sensation than others. Now,
whether this Difference is owing to the
Formation of the Nerves, or to the different
Velocity of the Blood circulating thro’
those Parts, or whether it is owing to the
different Quantity, or perhaps Acrimony, of
that Fluid which is separated from the Blood
by the <i>Nymphæ</i>, and other titillating Glands:
I say, from whencesoever this Difference
proceeds, according to the Degree of this
Sensation, we may venture to pronounce a
Woman more or less in their own Nature
Chaste.</p>

<p>To counterballance this violent natural
Desire, all young Women have strong Notions
of Honour carefully inculcated into
them from their Infancy. Young Girls
are taught to hate a <i>Whore</i>, before they
know what the Word means; and when
they grow up, they find their worldly
Interest entirely depending upon the Reputation
of their Chastity. This Sense of
Honour and Interest, is what we may call
artificial Chastity; and it is upon this
Compound of natural and artificial Chastity,
that every Woman’s real actual Chastity
depends.</p>

<p>As for Instance, some Women are naturally
more Chaste, or rather, to speak properly,
less Amorous than others, and at
the same time have very strict Notions of
Honour. Such Women are almost impregnable,
and may be compar’d to Towns
strongly fortify’d both by Art and Nature,
which, without Treachery, are safe from
any sudden Attacks, and must be reduc’d
by long and regular Sieges, such as few
Men have the Patience or Resolution to go
thro’ with.</p>

<p>Other Women, again, have the same Value
for their Reputation, and stand as much
upon the Puncto of Honour; but then they
are naturally of a very sanguine amorous
Disposition. A Woman of this Class may
not unjustly be compar’d to a Town well
garrison’d, but whose mutinous unruly <i>Inhabitants</i>
are strongly inclin’d to revolt and
<i>let in</i> the Enemy. Such Women, it’s true,
by extraordinary Care and Vigilance may
suppress these Mutinies; and Honour may
for a long while keep Inclination under,
but yet they are never perfectly safe; there
are certain Times and Seasons, certain unguarded
Hours, when Honour and Interest
are lull’d asleep, and Love has got the entire
Ascendant. Besides, altho’ we allow
Love and Honour to be pretty equal Combatants,
nay even granting, that in a <i>Pitch’d
Battle</i>, when they have muster’d up all
their Forces, Honour will have the Advantage,
and quell Inclination; yet, in the
Course of a long <i>Civil War</i>, it is Odds
but Love one Time or other obtains a Victory,
which is sure to be decisive: for Inclination
has this unlucky Advantage over
Honour, that, instead of being weaken’d,
it grows stronger by Subjection; and, like
<i>Camomile</i>, the more it is press’d down and
kept under, the sturdier it grows; or, like
<i>Antæus</i>, it receives fresh Vigour from every
Defeat, and rises the brisker the oftener it is
thrown. Whereas Honour once routed never
rallies; nay, the least <i>Breach</i> in Female
Reputation is irreparable; and a <i>Gap</i> in
Chastity, like a <i>Chasm</i> in a young Tree, is
every Day a <i>Widening</i>. Besides, Honour
and Interest require a long Chain of solid
Reasoning before they can be set in Battle-Array:
Whereas Inclination is presently under
Arms, the Moment Love has pitch’d his
<i>Standard</i>: For, as we find that the least
wanton Glance of a Lady’s Eye quickly
alarms a Man’s Animal Spirits, and puts the
whole Body Corporate into an unruly Ferment;
so, doubtless, the Female Imagination
is at least equally alert: and in such a
sudden Scuffle betwixt Love and Honour,
it is ten to one but the Enemy <i>enters</i>; for
the <i>Gate</i> of Chastity, like the <i>Temple</i> of
<i>Janus</i>, always stands <i>open</i> during these
Conflicts. It must indeed be granted, that
if the Loss of Honour was immediately to
succeed the Loss of Chastity, the Virtue of
these Women would be much stronger than
it is; but they flatter themselves with the
Hopes of Secrecy, and fancy that they have
found out an Expedient to purchase Pleasure
without the Expence of Reputation; by
this Means Honour is reconciled to Inclination,
or at best made to stand Neuter; and
then the Consequence is very obvious. In
short, a wanton Woman of Honour may
withstand a great many Attacks, and possibly
defend her Chastity to the very last; but
yet she is every Day in danger of being surpriz’d,
and at best will make but a very precarious
Defence.</p>

<p>A third Sort of Women, the very Reverse
of the preceding, have neither Honour
nor Inclination; that is to say, they have
neither the one nor the other to an equal
Degree with the rest of the Sex. These
Kinds of Women, who put a slighter Value
than ordinary upon their Characters, are generally,
in their Circumstances, either above
the World or below it; for when a Woman
has her Interest and Fortune depending
upon her Reputation, as all the middle
Rank of Womankind have, she is a Woman
of Honour of course. Interest, indeed,
is inseparable from Female Honour, nay, it
is the very Foundation of it; and Honour
and Interest, when they are consider’d
as Guardians to Chastity, are synonimous
Terms. The bare Puncto of Honour, when
abstracted from Interest, would prove but a
small Rub to Women in their eager Pursuit
of Pleasure: Thus we see the Conduct
of a Maiden Lady, how much more circumspect
it is whilst her Fortune in Marriage
is depending, than afterwards, when that
Point of Interest is secured by a Husband;
for all marry’d Women are above the
World, in so far as they are out of the
Reach of any Suspicions or Surmises, or
even a Probability of Incontinence; and
since they are not liable to be detected by
Pregnancy, there’s no other Sort of Conviction
able to prejudice them, but downright
ocular Demonstration: Which seems
to be the Reason why so many of them
take such Liberties, as if they were of
<i>Falstaff</i>’s Opinion, when he said, <i>Nothing
but Eyes confutes me</i>. Female Honour,
therefore, being so nearly ally’d and closely
annex’d to worldly Interest, we must
confine this Class of Women to two Sorts:
First, those whose Fortunes are independent,
and above being influenc’d by the
Censure of the World; and, secondly, those
who are far below the World, that they
either escape its Censure, or else are incapable
of being hurt by it. The first Sort lie
under this Disadvantage, that let their natural
Chastity be ever so great, the smallest
Spark of Desire is capable of being blown
up and rais’d to a considerable Pitch; whereas,
when a Woman is once arriv’d to Maturity,
that Portion of Honour which she
has acquir’d, is with Difficulty preserv’d, and
at best is incapable of any Improvement.
The second Sort are equally liable to have
their Passions rais’d, however low they may
be naturally, and besides lie under this farther
Disadvantage, that tho’ they cannot promote
their Interest by preserving their Chastity,
yet, if they have the least Spark of
Beauty, they will find their Account sufficiently
in parting with it. The Virtue, indeed,
of this Class of Women, seems chiefly
to depend upon the Degree of Beauty which
they stand possess’d of; for if they have
Charms sufficient to provoke young Men to
be at any tolerable Pains and Cost, their
Chastity can never hold out long, but must
infallibly surrender.</p>

<p>The fourth and last Kind of Women we
shall mention, are those who have a very
moderate Share of Honour, join’d to a very
amorous Constitution.</p>

<p>The Virtue of these Women is entirely
defenceless; and, as soon as a Man has removed
that little timorous Coyness, which
is natural to young Women in their first
Attempts, he may proceed with Confidence,
and conclude the Breach to be practicable;
for whatever Resistance he meets with afterwards,
will only enhance the Pleasure of
Conquest. Most Women, indeed, let them
be ever so fully resolv’d to comply, make
as great a Shew of Resistance as they can
conveniently counterfeit; and this the Sex
would pass upon the World for a kind of
innate Modesty: but it is very easily accounted
for.</p>

<p>As soon as Women have entertain’d any
Degree of Love, they make it their whole
Study to raise and maintain an equal Degree
of Passion in the Men; and they are very
sensible how far the bare Appearance of
Modesty will prevail to render them amiable.
The Pain they suffer in smothering
their Desires, is fully recompenced by that
secret Pleasure which a Lover’s Eagerness
gives them, because they esteem it a Proof
both of the Sincerity and Violence of his
Passion. A Woman is not, without some
Reason, afraid, lest a Man’s Love should diminish
after Enjoyment, and would gladly
bribe his After-Love, by the great Value she
seems to put upon her Chastity before she
makes him a Present of it.</p>

<p>Besides, not to mention the actual Pleasure
a Woman receives in Struggling, it is
a Justification of her in the Eye of the
Man, and a kind of <i>Salvo</i> to her Honour
and Conscience, that she never did fully
comply, but was in a manner forced into
it. This is the plain natural Reason why
most Women refuse to <i>surrender</i> upon <i>Treaty</i>,
and why they delight so much in being
<i>storm’d</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus taken a cursory View of the
Sex, in their several Classes, and according
to their several Circumstances, we may
conclude, preferring Truth to Complaisance,
that by far the greater Part of Womenkind
hold their Virtue very precariously;
and that Female Chastity is, in its own
Nature, built upon a very <i>ticklish</i> Foundation.</p>

<p><i>Hudibras</i> has ludicrously plac’d the Seat
of Male-Honour, in the Posteriors, whereby
it is secur’d from any Attack in Front; but
Female Honour, notwithstanding the apparent
Safety of the Situation, like a Debtor’s
House upon the Verge of two Counties, is
liable to be attack’d both Ways; <i>à parte</i>
ante, &amp; <i>à parte</i> post,</p>

<p>That the Seat of Honour in Females has
this double Aspect, like <i>Janus bifrons</i>, and
consequently that it is two Ways accessible,
has already been taken Notice of by almost
all the <i>Writers</i> upon this Subject;
but it is worth remarking here, that <i>Lycurgus</i>
had an Eye to it when he modelled
the <i>Spartan</i> Petticoat; for tho’ the Warmth
of the Climate obliged the Women to be
very open in that Part of their Dress, insomuch
that, if we believe <i>Plutarch</i>, in his
Comparison of <i>Numa</i> and <i>Lycurgus</i>, the
Habit which the Maidens of <i>Laconia</i> wore
came but to their Knees, and was open on
both Sides, so that as they walked their
Thighs appear’d bare; yet this wise <i>Law-giver</i>
would not permit them to make the
least Aperture, either in the fore or hind
Part of that Garment; rightly judging, that
those two sacred <i>Avenues</i> to a Maid’s Honour
ought to be guarded with the utmost
Caution.</p>

<p>For this same Reason the upright Posture
of the Body has always been esteem’d
the most decent; and it has ever been
the Mode, in all Countries, for Ladies to
cursey instead of bowing: for, tho’ a Female-Bow,
might seem a modest and coy Reclension
of the Body, with regard to the Person saluted,
yet it would occasion a very indecent Projection
to those who should happen to be
behind; especially since that dangerous Fashion
of <i>Postern-Plackets</i> has crept into the <i>European</i>
Petticoat.</p>

<p class="mt2em">But to return to our present Argument,
the Design of which was to prove the following
<i>Syllogism</i>.</p>

<p>The only way to preserve Female Chastity,
is to prevent the Men from laying
Siege to it: And this Project of the <i>Publick
Stews</i> is the only Way to prevent Mens
laying Siege to it: Therefore this Project
is the only Way to preserve Female
Chastity.</p>

<p>The former Part of the Proposition is, I
hope, sufficiently proved. It is, indeed, evident,
from the bare Consideration of the
Nature of Females, that if the Men are
suffer’d to go on, as they now do, in the
Pursuit of Pleasure, there is no possible Way
can be found out, effectually, to secure the
Virtue of any one Woman of any Rank, or
in any Station of Life. If a Woman is
handsome, she has the more Tryals to undergo;
if homely, and for that Reason seldom
attack’d, the Novelty of the Address
makes the greater Impression: If she is married,
it is odds but there’s a Failure at
home, and habitual Pleasures are not easily
foregone, especially when they may be enjoy’d
with Safety: If a Maid, her unexperienc’d
Virgin-Heart is capable of any Impression:
If she is rich, Ease and Luxury
make the Blood run mad; and Love, if
high-dieted, is ungovernable: If poor, she
will be the easier bribed, when Love and
Avarice jointly must be gratified.</p>

<p>In short, to sum up all, there is in the
Passion of Love a certain fatal <i>Crisis</i>, to
which all Womenkind are capable of being
wrought-up: The Difference of Virtue
consisting only in this, that it is very
hard to work a virtuous Woman up to this
<i>Crisis</i>, and requires a very unlucky Concurrence
of Circumstances: Whereas a Woman
without a good Stock of Virtue, must
have an unaccountable Series of good Fortune
if she escapes. But, virtuous or not
virtuous, when this Passion is once rais’d
to the <i>critical</i> Height, it is absolutely irresistible.</p>

<p>Since therefore Female Virtue cannot effectually
be secured, but by preventing the
Men from laying Siege to it, it remains for
us to examine, if this Prevention can be effected
by any other Method than that of erecting
the <i>Publick Stews</i>, and whether or no
when erected, they will have the desired
Effect.</p>

<p>That young Men, in a good State of
Health, have their Desires towards Women
much stronger, and more violent, than for
the Enjoyment of any thing else in this
Life, is a Truth not to be contested. And
it is likewise as certain, that young Men
will gratify these Desires, unless the <i>Legislature</i>
can affix such a Penalty to the Commission
of the Fact, that the Apprehension
of the Penalty may give their Minds more
Uneasiness, than refraining from the Gratification.</p>

<p>Now there are but three Things which
Men fear in this Life, <i>viz.</i> Shame, Poverty,
and Bodily Pain, and consequently but three
Sorts of Punishments, which the <i>Legislature</i>
can inflict. The first of these, indeed,
might be omitted; for Shame is so
very little in the Power of the Laws, that
it hardly deserves the Name of a Penalty.
If the Pillory, and such like infamous Punishments,
are more terrible for the Shame
that attends them, than for the bodily Pain,
it is not because such a Posture of a
Man’s Body, with his Neck through a
Hole, is in itself ignominious, or that
any Law can make it so; but because it
publishes to the World, that a Man has
been prov’d to commit such a certain Action,
in its own Nature scandalous, which
he is asham’d to have thus publickly made
known. The truth is, “Honour and Dishonour
being only the different Opinions of
Mankind, as to the Good or Evil of any
Action; and these Opinions in the Mind
arising, as Dr. <i>Clarke</i> well observes,
from the natural Fitness or Unfitness of
the Actions themselves, cannot be alter’d
or determin’d by any <i>Secular Force</i>.” And
that they are entirely out of the Power
of the <i>Legislature</i>, is evident in the Instance
of <i>Duelling</i>; where a Man often receives
Honour for a <i>Breach</i> of the Law, nay
is forced to <i>break</i> it in <i>Defence</i> of his
Honour.</p>

<p>The utmost Scandal, therefore, which the
Laws can affix to any Action, is to make a
full and open Publication of the Fact: Now
it is evident that this Publication cannot
have a sufficient Influence over Mens Minds
to deter them from Wenching, a Crime
which meets with so favourable a Reception
in the Eye of the World, that young Men
are not asham’d to boast of it.</p>

<p>We must have Recourse then to a Fine, or
Corporal Punishment, or perhaps both. If
it is a Fine, it must be one of these three
sorts; either a certain determinate Sum for
every Offence, or, to make it fall more
equally, such a certain Portion of a Man’s
whole Substance, or else it must be such a
Sum as the Jury shall think sufficient to repair
the Woman’s Damages. The first is
impracticable because of its Inequality, with
regard to Mens different Fortunes. The second
would punish none but Men of Fortune.
And the third, in many Cases, would
be impossible; for Women are often ruin’d
by such as have it not in their power to
make them amends. But granting that a
Fine could be so happily contriv’d as to affect
all Men equally in their several Stations
of Life; and let us suppose this Fine considerable
enough, for so it must be, to deter any
moderate-spirited Man: yet still we lie under
a manifest Dilemma as to the Point of
Proof; for if the Proof is to depend upon
the Evidence of Eye-Witnesses, none but
Fools will be convicted; and let a Man be
ever so indiscreet, he that swears to <i>rem in
re</i> must have good Eyes, and be a good
Swearer withal. If, on the other hand, a
Man is to be convicted upon the sole Evidence
of the Woman, we run into greater
Inconveniences: for either a Woman is to
be recompenced for the Injury she has received,
or not; if not, there is no modest
Woman of common Sense, but will chuse
much rather to conceal her Weakness, than
expose it in publick Court so much to her
own Prejudice; and this too upon the sole
Motive of doing Prejudice to a Man, for
whom, in all Probability, she still retains an
Affection: So that no Man would be accus’d
but by such sort of Women as the Law can
never intend to favour or countenance.</p>

<p>And if the Woman is to receive this Fine,
either in Part or the Whole, by way of Reparation,
not to mention its being an actual
Encouragement to transgress, this Recompence
would only be a Means to promote
a Multitude of false Accusations; for what
Man could live with so much Circumspection,
that a Woman might not often have an
Opportunity to accuse him of such a Fact,
with very probable Circumstances, when there
is no Opportunity of detecting the Fallacy.
This Difficulty, indeed, is not to be got
over; and the Objection lies equally strong
against all sorts of Corporal Punishment,
Death itself not excepted. For if there are
so many false Indictments for <i>Rapes</i>, where
a Woman receives no Benefit by the Prosecution,
where she is liable to such cross Examinations,
and where the Possibility of the
Fact is so much doubted, that a Woman is
generally discountenanc’d, and must bring a
Number of probable concurrent Circumstances
before she can gain Credit: I say, if notwithstanding
these Discouragements, there
are so many malicious Prosecutions for
<i>Rapes</i>, that the Benefit of the Law in general
is much disputed, what may we expect
in the present Case, where a Woman has
nothing to do but acknowledge that she was
over-persuaded, and then all Difficulties vanish?
Besides, if such a Law was made,
setting aside that the Remedy would be
worse than the Disease, it is much to be
question’d if it prov’d any Remedy at all:
For what Fine can we propose as sufficient
to deter Men, when there are so many that
squander away their whole Fortunes upon
this sole Gratification? And what Corporal
Punishment, on this side Death, can we
find out equivalent to a <i>Pox</i>, which they
every day run the Risque of?</p>

<p>But no such Law, as yet, has been so
much as propos’d, altho’ Whoring has been
a very obvious Mischief ever since Laws were
in Being; therefore, without farther Argument,
considering the Wisdom of our <i>Legislature</i>,
that such a Law never has been
made, ought to be sufficient Reason for us to
judge it impracticable.</p>

<p>Since the Torrent of Lewdness, then, is
too strong to be opposed by open Force, let
us see if we can find out an Expedient to
divert it by Policy, and prevent the Mischief
tho’ we can’t prevent the Crime.</p>

<p>Most <i>Authors</i>, who have writ of Government,
have chose to express their Sentiments
by comparing the Public Body with the
Body Natural; and Mr. <i>Hobbes</i>, in his <i>Leviathan</i>,
has carry’d the <i>Allegory</i> as far as
it will go. To make Use of it in the present
Instance, we may look upon <i>Whoring</i>
as a Kind of Peccant Humour in the Body-Politic,
which, in order to its Discharge,
naturally seizes upon such external Members
as are most liable to Infection, and at the
same time most proper to carry off the Malignity.
If this Discharge is promoted by a
Licence for <i>Publick Stews</i>, which is a Kind
of legal Evacuative, the Constitution will
certainly be preserv’d: Whereas, if we apply
Penal Laws, like violent Astringents,
they will only drive the Disease back into
the Blood; where, gathering Strength, and
at last assimilating the whole Mass, it will
break out with the utmost Virulence, to the
apparent Hazard of those sound Members,
which otherwise might have escaped the
Contagion. As we may observe in a <i>Clap</i>,
where Nature of her own Accord expels the
noxious Humour thro’ the same Passages by
which it was at first receiv’d; but if we resist
Nature in this Discharge, and repel the
Venom by too hasty an Application of
<i>Styptics</i>, the Disease then turns to a <i>Pox</i>,
seizes the Vitals, and, to use <i>Solomon</i>’s
Words, <i>like a Dart, strikes thro’ the Liver</i>.
But, leaving <i>Allegory</i> as more proper
for <i>Rhetoric</i> or <i>Poetry</i>, than such serious
Debates, since this Project of the <i>Public
Stews</i> is the only Expedient now left for the
Preservation of Female Chastity, the Question
is, Whether or no this Expedient will really
answer the End propos’d?</p>

<p>To prove the Affirmative, requires no more
but that we look into ourselves, and examine
our own Passions; for Love ever was and
will be the same in all Men, and in all Ages.
The first amorous Emotions that young Men
feel, are violent; they are plagued with a
Stimulation, which raises a vehement Desire:
The Passion is strong, but then it is general;
it is Lust, not Love: And therefore the natural
Impatience of <i>Lust</i> will prompt them
to take the speediest way for present Gratification,
and make them prefer the ready and
willing Embraces of a Courtezan, before the
doubtful and distant Prospect of enjoying a
modest Damsel, whose Coyness will cost
so much Pains, as well as Time, to overcome;
and, when overcome, may probably occasion
a future Uneasiness, and give them more
Trouble after Enjoyment than they had before.</p>

<p>Besides this, if their first Affections should
happen to be engaged to a particular Object,
which is very rare; and that this particular
Object was in their Power to compass, which
is still rarer; yet there is naturally in Young-Men
a certain secret Shame, which attends
their first Sallies, and prevents their declaring
a private Passion, ’till it grows so violent, that
they are forced to give it Vent upon the Publick;
and by that means, get into a regular
Method of making themselves easy, without
doing their Modesty any Violence.</p>

<p>But tho’ the natural Bent of Men’s Minds
inclines them to an easy Purchase of Pleasure
in their first Amours, yet publick Whoring
lies at present under so many Disadvantages;
the Publick Women, for want of good Regulation,
are so infamous in their Principles and
Practice; the Places of Resort so vile, and
so scandalously imposing in the common Expence,
and lying under the Lash of the
<i>Civil</i> Power, so pester’d with the mercenary
Officiousness of <i>Reforming Constables</i>; and
which is worst of all, the Plague of <i>Claps</i>
and <i>Poxes</i> is so inevitable, that Men contrary
to their Inclinations are often forc’d to enter
upon private Intrigues, either without trying
the Publick, or after meeting with some Misfortunes
in the Tryal.</p>

<p>Now if we see daily so many Young Men,
who prefer the publick Commerce under all
these Disadvantages, what Success may we
not expect from this happy Establishment of
the <i>Stews</i>, when the Young Women’s Behaviour
will be regulated after a civil decent
Manner; when the Houses of Entertainment
will be so Commodious, and the Expence of
Accomodation so reasonable; when the horrid
Dread of <i>Claps</i> is entirely remov’d; and
when the Laws, instead of disturbing such
Assemblies, will be employ’d in their Protection,
to give them the greater Countenance
and Encouragement; surely we may hope for
a thorough Reformation.</p>

<p>But if these Considerations should not prove
fully effectual, and some Men should be so
obstinate as to persist in private Whoring, notwithstanding
these Inducements to the contrary;
we must then have Recourse to <i>Legal</i>
Force, and drive those who are too resty to be
led: For tho’ the Laws can’t prevent Whoring,
they may yet regulate it; the <i>Quid</i> is not in
their Power, but the <i>Quomodo</i> is. A Man must
eat, but he may be directed how to eat. The
strongest Curb can’t stop an unruly Horse, but
the weakest will serve to turn him: And the
smallest Stream is not to be obstructed, tho’ we
can change the Course of the greatest River.
So Love, tho’ ever so unruly and headstrong in
the general, changes the particular Object of
its Passion with the smallest Circumstance;
and legal Penalties are no trifling Dissuasives,
when the Laws don’t command Impossibilities.</p>

<p>This Argument indeed, of Compulsion, is
in a manner supernumerary, and thrown in,
as it were, <i>ex abundanti</i>: For <i>the Publick Stews</i>
under this regular Oeconomy, will have so
much the Advantage of private Whoring,
whether we regard the Ease and Conveniency
of Enjoyment, or the Beauty and Variety of
Mistresses, that Men’s natural Inclinations will
sway them sufficiently without this superfluous
Constraint. If there is any Fear of Success,
the Danger lies on the other Side; and indeed
we have some Colour of Reason to apprehend,
lest the whole Body of Lewdness being turn’d
upon the Publick, there should want a sufficient
Supply of young Women to recruit the <i>Stews</i>;
which, by that Means, may run into a sudden
Dis-repute, and lose a Character that will be
difficult to retrieve. But however plausible
this Objection may seem at first Sight, we shall
find, upon a nearer View, that it only serves to
make the Excellence of this Scheme the more
manifest.</p>

<p>As there is constantly in the Nation, a certain
Number of young Men, whose Passions
are too strong to brook any Opposition: Our
Business is to contrive a Method how they may
be gratify’d, with as little Expence of Female
Virtue as possible. But the Difficulty lies in
adjusting this Matter, and gaging our young
Men’s Affections so exactly, that the Modesty
of one Woman may not be sacrifis’d, more
than is absolutely necessary for the Preservation
of the rest.</p>

<p>The Gallants of this Age, indeed, are not
quite so sturdy as that rampant <i>Roman</i> Emperor
who deflower’d ten <i>Sarmatian</i> Virgins in one
Night; but what we want in Constitution, we
make up in the Niceity of our Palates; as a
squeamish Stomach requires the greatest Variety
of Dishes: And some of our Youth are grown
such perfect <i>Epicures</i> in Venery, that they can
relish nothing but <i>Virgins</i>: They destroy, it is
true, a great deal of Beauty, by browsing only
upon the Buds.</p>

<p>But we ought not to judge of these Men’s
Abilities by the Number of Women they debauch,
no more than we should measure the
Goodness of a certain curious Gentleman’s Appetite
by his bespeaking several Dozen of young
Pigeons, when he only regal’d upon the Rumps:
Neither is it intirely from a Wantonness of
Fancy, or a luxurious Taste of Pleasure, that
Men indulge themselves in making this Havock,
but chiefly for their own personal Safety. Young
Girls are so giddy, thoughtless, and unexperienc’d,
and withal so fond of the Sport, at their first
setting out, that they seldom escape a Taint;
and a Man is not safe in being constant: Nay,
some Men are afraid of venturing even after
themselves. By this Means several likely
Women, that might do the Publick signal
Service, are in a short Time render’d useless:
And, by a modest Computation, we are put to
the Expence of as many virtuous Women in one
Year, as might reasonably serve the Nation six.</p>

<p>Now, the <i>Publick Stews</i> will regulate this
Affair so precisely, and with such critical Exactness,
that one Year with another, we shall not
have one Woman employ’d in the Publick
Service more than is absolutely necessary, nor
one less than is fully sufficient.</p>

<p>When this Project is first set on foot, the
vast Choice and Variety there is at present of
these Women, will give us an Opportunity of
making a very beautiful Collection; and will,
doubtless, for some Time, occasion a considerable
Run upon the Publick; so that <i>Private Whoring</i>,
the only Nursery of our Courtezans, may probably
remain too long neglected: For the whole
Body of our incontinent Youth, like a standing
Army, being employ’d in constant Action,
there cannot well be spar’d a sufficient Detachment
to raise the necessary Recruits.</p>

<p>But however true this may be, we shall
thereby suffer no Inconvenience; for if the
Supplies of young Women, which we may
reasonably expect from the Northern and
Western Parts of these Kingdoms, or from such
Places as are remote and out of the Influence
of this <i>Scheme</i>: I say, if these Supplies should
not prove sufficient to answer the Greatness of
the Demand, and that the Reputation of the
<i>Stews</i> upon this Account, should begin to flag,
why then the worst Accident that can befal,
is a gradual Relapse into our former State of
<i>Private Whoring</i>; and this no farther than is
just necessary and to recruit the <i>Stews</i>, and
thereby make them retrieve their former Character:
For every Woman who is debauch’d
more than is barely necessary, only brings so
much additional Credit and Reputation to the
<i>Stews</i>, and in some measure atones for the Loss
of her own Chastity, by being a Means to preserve
that of others; so that whenever the Tide
of private Lewdness runs too high, and exceeds
the just and ordinary Bounds, it must of Course,
by encouraging the <i>Publick Stews</i>, immediately
suffer a proportionable Ebb: That is to say,
it must be reduced again so low, that there will
remain but just a sufficient Quantity to supply
the <i>Stews</i>; which is as low, as in the Nature of
the Thing is possible.</p>

<p>I might here lavish out Encomiums, and
take Occasion to dwell upon those many Advantages
that will accrue to the <i>Nation</i> by this
admirable Scheme; but shall only take Notice
of this peculiar Excellence, which it has above all
other Schemes, that it necessarily executes itself.</p>

<p>But since the Necessity of debauching a
certain Number of young Women, is entirely
owing to the Necessity of supplying the <i>Public
Stews</i>; a Question may very reasonably arise,
whether this Project might not be vastly improv’d,
even to the total Extirpation of <i>Private
Whoring</i>, by an Act <i>for encouraging the Importation
of foreign Women</i>. This, I must confess,
deserves a serious Debate: for, besides the Honour
of our Females, which would be preserv’d
by such an Act, it might bring this farther
Advantage; That whereas most of our estated
Youth spend a great Part of their Time and
Fortunes in travelling Abroad, for no other End,
as it seems by most of them, but to be inform’d
in the <i>French</i> and <i>Italian</i> Gallantry; they
would then have an Opportunity of satisfying
their Curiosity in Foreign Amours, without
stirring out of <i>London</i>. But I shall leave the
Decision of this Matter to abler Pens, well
knowing, that a Truth of this Nature, which
carries so much the Air of Novelty, will require
much better Authority than mine to warrant it.</p>

<p>Let it suffice for the present, that I have fully
prov’d what I at first propos’d in this Treatise:
That <i>Public Whoring</i> is neither so criminal in
itself, nor so detrimental to the <i>Society</i>, as <i>Private
Whoring</i>; and that the encouraging of
<i>Publick Whoring</i>, by erecting <i>Stews</i> for that
Purpose, will not only prevent most of the
mischievous Consequences of this Vice, but
even lessen the Quantity of <i>Whoring</i> in general,
and reduce it to the narrowest Bounds which it
can possibly be contain’d in.</p>

<p>After what has been said, it may, perhaps,
appear somewhat odd to talk of Religious
Objections, as if either Christianity or Morality
could possibly object against a <i>Scheme</i>, which is
entirely calculated for the Welfare and Happiness
of Mankind. But since a great many
Men amongst us have entertained such whimsical
Notions of Religion, as to imagine, that in some
Cases, a Law may be unjust and wicked, tho’
it evidently promotes the Publick Good: as if
the right Enjoyment of this Life was inconsistent
with our Happiness in the next: I say,
since many Men of Understanding have suffer’d
themselves to be possess’d with this mistaken
Principle, I shall, as briefly as may be, answer
such Objections as can, with any Colour of
Reason, be offer’d.</p>

<p>First then, I expect to be attack’d with that
old moral Precept, of <i>Not doing Evil that Good
may come of it</i>. This may be answer’d with
another old Saying, equally authentic, and
more applicable to the present Purpose, that
<i>of two Evils we ought to chuse the least</i>. The
Case is this: A private Member of a <i>Society</i>,
may, doubtless, commit a Crime with a Design
to promote the Good of that <i>Society</i>, which was
partly the Case of <i>Felton</i> against the Duke of
<i>Buckingham</i>; and this evil Action may possibly
answer the Goodness of the Intention, but is
universally condemn’d as an unwarrantable Presumption;
and falls justly under the Censure of
doing a certain Evil, for the Prospect of an uncertain
Good. But as to the <i>Legislature</i>, there
is a wide Difference; for they, and they only,
are intrusted with the Welfare of the <i>Society</i>:
This Publick Welfare is, or ought to be, the
whole End and Scope of their Actions; and
they are fully impower’d to do whatever they
judge conducive to that End. If their Intentions
come up to this, they are certainly in their
Consciences acquitted: But as to the World,
their Actions, that is, their Laws, are judg’d
good or bad, just or unjust, according as they
actually prove beneficial or detrimental to the
<i>Society</i> in general: And therefore it is the
grossest Absurdity, and a perfect Contradiction
in Terms, to assert, That a <i>Government</i> may
not commit Evil that Good may come of it;
for, if a Publick Act, taking in all its Consequences,
really produces a greater Quantity of
Good, it must, and ought to be term’d a good
Act; altho’ the bare Act, consider’d in itself,
without the consequent Good, should be in the
highest Degree wicked and unjust.</p>

<p>As for Instance: A Ship performing Quarantine,
and known to be infected, is sunk by a
Storm; some of the Crew, half drown’d, recover
the Shore; but the Moment they land, the <i>Government</i>
orders them to be shot to Death.
This Action, in itself, is no less than a downright
unchristian and inhuman Murther; but
since the Health and Safety of the Nation is
secured by this severe Precaution, it is no Wonder,
if we allow the Action to be not only justifiable,
but in the strictest Sense of Morality Just.</p>

<p>Another Objection, or rather the same set
in a stronger Light, is, That altho’ the Welfare
and Happiness of the Community is, or ought
to be, the only End of all Law and Government,
yet since our spiritual Welfare is the
<i>Summum Bonum</i> which all Christians should aim
at, no Christian Government ought to authorize
the Commission of the least known Sin, tho’
for the greatest temporal Advantage.</p>

<p>To this Objection, I answer, That it is universally
allow’d as one of the greatest Perfections
of the Christian Religion, that its Precepts are
calculated to promote the Happiness of Mankind
in this World as well as the next; if so,
then it is a direct Arraignment of the Lawgiver’s
infinite Wisdom, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a Contradiction to
assert, that, in Matters of Law and Government,
the Publick Breach of any Gospel Precept can
possibly be for the temporal Good of any <i>Society</i>
whatever: And therefore we may with Confidence
affirm, that no sinful Laws can be beneficial,
and <i>vice versa</i>, that no beneficial Laws
can be sinful. Now we have already given
sufficient Proof of the Benefit the <i>Public</i> would
receive by licensing the <i>Stews</i>, and therefore
ought to conclude such Licence lawful; but
lest the apparent Wickedness of the <i>Stews</i>,
should be objected against this general Reasoning,
it is fit that we examine this Matter a
little nearer.</p>

<p><i>Fornication</i> is, no doubt, a direct Breach of
a <i>Gospel</i>-Precept, and is therefore a Sin; but
this Sin, barely as such, concerns the <i>Government</i>
no more than the Eating of <i>Black-puddings</i>,
equally prohibited in the <span class="nowrap">same <a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> Text. The
Reason is this: The Sin consists in a full Intention
to gratify a Lustful Desire; which Intention
the <i>Legislature</i> cannot possibly prevent:
Penalties indeed may deter Men from gratifying
their Desires, at the Expence of the Public, but
will rather increase than lessen the Desires themselves.
If it is argu’d, that the Sin of the
Intention is aggravated by being put in Execution,
so much the better for our Purpose; for
then the Argument stands thus:</p>

<p>Since the Sin of the Intention is entirely out
of the <i>Legislature</i>’s Power, the utmost they
can do, with regard to this Sin, is, to prevent
its being aggravated by actual Commission.</p>

<p>But the <i>Public Stews</i>, as we have already
prov’d, will prevent as much as possible this
actual Commission.</p>

<p>Therefore the <i>Publick Stews</i> will prevent as
much as possible this <span class="smcap">Sin</span>.</p>

<p>Another Branch of this Objection, without
which the Objection itself would be of no
Force, is, that the authorizing of <i>Public Stews</i>
is a Public Encouragement for People to Whore.</p>

<p>If by People are meant those in the <i>Stews</i>,
I hope it will be thought no Crime to encourage
such People, rather to confine themselves to
the Practice of one Vice, than live by committing
a Thousand; especially when that one Vice
is what they would really practise, whether
they were encourag’d or not.</p>

<p>But if any imagine that this particular
Licence would be a general Encouragement to
the whole <i>Nation</i>, they are certainly mistaken.
For, as to the Men, they are already as bad as
they can be; if any Thing cures them, it must
be <i>Satiety</i>: Let them have full and free Leave
to take a Surfeit of unlawful Love, and they
will soon learn to prefer the Chaste Embraces
of Innocence before the bought Smile of
Harlots loveless, joyless, unindear’d casual
Fruition.</p>

<p>It is a right Observation, that Restraint does
but whet a Man’s Passions instead of curing
them.</p>

<p><i>Exuperat magis, ægrescitque medendo.</i> Æn. 12.
And a late ingenious <i>Author</i>, who study’d Mankind,
speaking on this Subject, has these Words:
<i>To put down</i> Publick Stews, <i>is not only to disperse
Fornication into all Parts, but, by the
Difficulty, to excite wild and wanton People to
this Vice.</i></p>

<p>It was observ’d at <i>Rome</i>, that in the full
Liberty of Divorces, there was not a single
Instance of one in fifty Years: And that <i>Cato</i>
long’d for his Wife again as soon as she was in
another’s Possession.</p>

<p>The Master of Love says positively,</p>

<p>
<i>Quod licet ingratum est, quod non licet acrius urit</i>.
</p>

<p>And <i>Martial</i> speaking to a married Rake,
<i>B</i>. 3. <i>Ep</i>. 68. says,</p>

<p>
<i>Cur aliena placet tibi, quæ tua non placet uxor?
Nunquid Securus non potes arrigere?</i><br />
</p>

<p>
I pr’ythee tell me why a Wife<br />
&emsp;Thy am’rous Fancy never warms?<br />
What! without Danger o’thy Life,<br />
&emsp;Cannot thy Cod-pice stand to Arms?<br />
</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;And again, <i>B</i>. 1. <i>Ep</i>. 74.</p>

<p>
<i>Nullus in urbe fuit tota, qui tangere vellet<br />
Uxorem gratis, Cæciliane, tuam<br />
Dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens<br />
Turba fututorum est. Ingeniosus Homo es.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
There’s no Man, <i>Cæcil</i>, in the Town,<br />
&emsp;Would, <i>gratis</i>, have enjoy’d thy Spouse;<br />
But how thou art so jealous grown,<br />
&emsp;Lord! what a Croud about the House!<br />
You’ve lock’d her up, t’increase her Value;<br />
In short, you are a cunning Fellow.<br />
</p>

<p>The <i>Public Stews</i> will not encourage Men to
be lewd, but they will encourage them to exercise
their Lewdness in a proper Place, without
disturbing the Peace of the <i>Society</i>, and with
as little Detriment to themselves as possible.
And, as to the Women, there’s not the least
Shadow of Encouragement: For no modest
Woman ever lost her Maiden-head with the dismal
Prospect of becoming a <i>Public Courtezan</i>:
And if a Woman is not modest, the licensing
of the <i>Public Stews</i> is no more an Encouragement
for her to practise, than the allowing a
certain Number of Hackney-Coaches every
<i>Sunday</i> is an Encouragement for the rest to ply;
when the very Licence, to some, expresly implies
a Prohibition of the rest.</p>

<p>Having now sufficiently proved the Institution
of the <i>Public Stews</i> to be a Political Good,
and answer’d all the religious Objections against
it; I shall conclude with observing, That I
have the Authority of <i>Italy</i>, the most Politic
Nation in the World, to back me in the first
Part of my Argument; and the Opinion of
<i>Holland</i>, one of the strictest Reformed Churches,
to vindicate me in the second; and that we
ourselves enjoy’d the Benefit of this Institution
till we were depriv’d of it by the over-hasty Zeal
of our first Reformers in the sixteenth Century.</p>

<p>The <i>Public Stews</i> were antiently kept in <i>Southwark</i>,
by an express Licence from the Government,
and open Permission both Civil and Ecclesiastical,
for they paid regular Taxes to the <i>Lord-Mayor</i>
of the <i>City</i>, and to the Bishop of the <i>See</i>.</p>

<p>We do not find that they were ever molested
’till the 25th of <i>Edward</i> the Third, when, in
the Parliament at <i>Westminster</i>, at the Request of
the <i>Londoners</i>, says <i>Daniel</i>, an Act passed, obliging
all Common Whores to distinguish themselves,
by wearing Hoods striped with divers Colours,
or Furs, and their Gowns turn’d <i>inside</i> out.</p>

<p>This, indeed, was but a Trifle to what they
suffer’d thirty Years after by <i>Wat Tyler</i>’s Rebellion.</p>

<p>In the fifth of <i>Richard</i> the Second, <i>Wat</i>
marched up from <i>Dartworth</i>, with a true Spirit
of Reformation, fully resolv’d to burn and
destroy every thing that oppos’d him: If the
Archbishop’s Palace at <i>Lambeth</i> could not escape,
there was little Mercy to be expected for the
<span class="nowrap"><i>Stews</i> <a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span>; besides, Whoring was not the least of
<i>Wat</i>’s Grievances: He began his Rebellion by
killing a Collector of the Poll-Tax for being
a little too brisk upon his Daughter; and his
Antipathy to the <i>Stews</i> was still increased, by
the <i>Lord-Mayor</i>’s shutting the City-Gates, and
denying him Entrance; for he could not revenge
the Affront more effectually, than by <i>cutting
off so large a Branch of his Lordship’s Revenue</i>.</p>

<p>In short, every thing concurred to the Destruction
of the <i>Stews</i>, and demolish’d they
were.</p>

<p>This Action, however, lost <i>Tyler</i> his Life;
for <i>William Walworth</i>, then Lord-Mayor, was
the very Man who struck him first off his
Horse in <i>Smithfield</i>: For which the King
knighted him, gave him 100<i> l.</i> Pension, and
added the Dagger to the City-Arms.</p>

<p>Whilst Whoring was in this unsettled Condition,
the <i>Bishop</i> thought it a good Opportunity
to ingross the whole Profit of licensing
Courtezans, which occasion’d them fresh Trouble;
for <i>John Northampton</i>, who succeeded
<i>Walworth</i>, either piqued at the Bishop’s invading
his Right, or out of a real Reforming Principle,
for he was a Follower of <i>Wickliff</i>, commenced
a severe Persecution. He had his Spies and
Constables in every Street, to apprehend Strollers;
and such Women as were neither handsome nor
rich enough to bribe his Officers, were carried
through the Streets in great Pomp, with their
Hair shorn, and Trumpets and Pipes playing
before them. All this he did contrary to the
express Commands of the Bishop, who had
several Bickerings with him upon that Head.</p>

<p>This great Reformer <i>John Northampton</i> was,
from his troublesome Temper, nick-nam’d
<i>Cumber-Town</i>; and as he succeeded <i>Tyler</i> in
the Work of Reformation, so he had like to
have met with as bad a Fate: For two Years
after he was found guilty of High Treason,
without making the least Defence; had his
Goods confiscated, and was condemned to
perpetual Imprisonment 100 Miles from <i>London</i>:
Accordingly he was sent to <i>Tentagil-Castle</i> in
<i>Cornwall</i>.</p>

<p>This dreadful <i>Cumber-Town</i> being removed,
the <i>Stews</i> had Leisure to re-settle themselves under
the Protection of the Church; and enjoyed
an almost uninterrupted Tranquillity for 150
Years.</p>

<p>We find, indeed, an Act passed at <i>Westminster</i>,
in the 11th of <i>Hen.</i> VI. that no Keepers
of <i>Stews</i>, or <i>Whore-Houses</i> in <i>Southwark</i>, should
be impannelled upon any Jury, or keep a Tavern
in any other Place.</p>

<p>But the most sensible Blow they ever felt,
was the Invasion of the <i>French-Pox</i>. The
<i>Spaniards</i> had brought it from the Islands of
<i>Florida</i> to <i>Naples</i>, and the Army of <i>Charles</i>
VIII. when he conquer’d that Kingdom in
the Year 1495, transmitted it into <i>France</i>, from
whence it had a very quick Passage into <i>England</i>;
for there was an Act passed in the latter
end of <i>Henry</i> VII’s Reign, for expelling out
of the <i>Stews</i> all such Women as had the Faculty
of <i>Burning</i> Men.</p>

<p>However, we find they still continued in
good Repute in the Reign of <i>Henry</i> VIII<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>
and yielded a considerable Revenue to the
<i>Bishop</i> of <i>London</i>; for <i>Bucer</i>, in one of his
Books against <i>Gardiner</i>, taxes him with it as
<i>an heinous Crime, that he should receive most of
his Rents out of the Public Stews</i>.</p>

<p>After this terrible Accusation, we may easily
guess what Quarter our <i>Stews</i> met with at the
Reformation. But now <i>Bucer</i> has got his Ends;
the <i>Stews</i> are destroy’d; those public Nusances are
demolish’d; Whoring is attack’d on all hands
without Mercy; and what then? Why, truly,
by mere Dint of <i>Reforming</i>, we have reduced
Lewdness to that pass, that hardly one Bachelor
in the Kingdom will lie with a Woman, if he
is sure that she’s not found; and very few modest
Women will suffer a Man to get them
with Child, unless he makes a Promise to marry.</p>

<p>In short, the Truth is, we are at this present
Writing as <i>bad</i> as we can be; and I hope I
have fairly shown how we may be <i>better</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt"><i>RICHARD RAWLINSON</i></em>, L.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D.
and R.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. in his Account of <i>Southwark</i><span class="nowrap">, <a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>
informs us, that next to the <i>Bear-Garden</i>
on the Bank-Side was formerly the
<span class="smcap">Bordello</span>, or <span class="smcap">Stewes</span>, so called from several
Licensed Houses for the Entertainment of
Lewd Persons, in which were Women prepared
for all Comers. They were subject to
several Laws and Regulations, and their Manner
of Life and Privileged Places, received
several Confirmations from the Crown.</p>

<p>In 1162, King <i>Henry</i> II, in a <i>Parliament</i>
held at <i>Westminster</i>, passed an Act, confirming
several Ordinances, Statutes, and old Customs
observed in that Place, amongst which the
following are remarkable:</p>

<p class="mt2em">That no <i>Stew-Holder</i> or his Wife, should
lett or stay any single Woman to go and come
freely at all Times when she listed.</p>

<p>No <i>Stewholder</i> to keep any Woman to board,
but she to board abroad at her Pleasure.</p>

<p>To take no more for the Woman’s Chamber
than <i>fourteen</i> Pence.</p>

<p>Not to keep open his Doors upon the Holy-days.</p>

<p>Not to keep any single Woman in his House
on the Holy-days, but the <i>Bailiff</i> to see them
voided out of the Lordship.</p>

<p>No single Woman to be kept against her
Will, that would leave her Sin.</p>

<p>No <i>Stew-Holder</i> to receive any Woman of
Religion, or any Mans Wife.</p>

<p>No single Woman to take Money to lie with
any Man, except she lye with him all Night,
till the Morrow.</p>

<p>No Man to be drawn or enticed into any
<i>Stew-House</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Constables</i>, <i>Bailiffs</i>, and others, were
every Week to search every <i>Stew-House</i>.</p>

<p>No <i>Stew-Holder</i> to keep any Woman that
hath the perillous Infirmity of <i>Burning</i>, nor to
sell Bread, Ale, Flesh, Fish, Wood, Coal, or
any sort of Victuals.</p>

<p class="mt2em">Anno 1345, Stews were licenced by King
<i>Edward</i> III. Anno 1381, these Stew-Houses
belonged to <i>William Walworth</i>, Lord-Mayor of
<i>London</i>, who let them out to some <i>Flemish</i> Women,
and soon after they were plundered by <i>Walter
Tyler</i>, and the rebellious <i>Kentishmen</i>, when probably
they were put down, and again suffered, and
afterwards confirmed by <i>Henry</i> VI. In 1506,
King <i>Henry</i> VII. for some Time shut up these
Houses, which were in Number <i>Eighteen</i>, and
not long after renewed their Licence, and reduced
them to <i>Twelve</i>; at which Number they
continued till their final Suppression by Sound
of Trumpet, in 1546, by King <i>Henry</i> VIII,
whose tender Conscience startled at such scandalous
and open Lewdness. The single Women
who were Retainers to, or Inmates in, these
Houses, were excommunicated, not suffered to
enter the Church while alive, or if not reconciled
before their Death, prohibited Christian
Burial, and were interred in a Piece of Ground
called the <i>Single-Women’s Church-Yard</i>, set
a-part for their Use only. These Houses were
distinguished by several Signs painted on their
Fronts, as, a <i>Boar’s-Head</i>, the <i>Crane</i>, the
<i>Cardinal’s Hat</i>, the <i>Swan</i>, the <i>Bell</i>, the <i>Castle</i>,
the <i>Cross-Keys</i>, and the <i>Gun</i>.</p>

<p class="tac"><i>An Attempt to prove the Antiquity of the</i>
Venereal Disease, <i>long before the Discovery
of the</i> West-Indies; <i>in a Letter
to Dr.</i> <span class="smcap">James Douglass</span>, <i>M.&nbsp;D.</i></p>


<p class="ml1em"><em class="gesperrt"><i>SIR</i></em>,</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">THE</em> Undertaking I am at present engaged
in, is to prove that the <i>Venereal Disease</i>
was known among us, much earlier than the
<i>Æra</i>, which has been generally assign’d for its
Rise by modern Authors; for it is believed it
was not known, at least in <i>Europe</i>, till about the
Year 1494. Notwithstanding which, I determine
to make it evident, that it was frequent
among us some Hundreds of Years before that
Date. I could mention several Physicians and
Surgeons of Eminence, who have been of the
same Sentiments, particularly, the Learned
Dr. <i>Charles Patin</i>, who has written a curious
Dissertation to prove the <i>Antiquity of this
Disease</i>, which is sufficient to excuse me from
the Imputation of having started a Novelty,
or being at the trouble of quoting antient Authorities
before taken notice of, from the most
ancient Writers of Medicine; as <i>Hippocrates</i>,
<i>Galen</i>, <i>Avicen</i>, <i>Celsus</i>, &amp;c. and even the
<i>Holy Scriptures</i>. I shall therefore lay aside all
those foreign Aids and Assistances, and trace out
the Symptoms of the Disease, as they naturally
arise, from the <i>first</i> Infection to the <i>last</i> destructive
Period, and shew that, by searching
into our own Antiquities, we may be furnished
with Instances of the Frequency of the Distemper
among us, in all its respective Stages, before
ever our Modern Authors dream it had its Appearance
in <i>Europe</i>,</p>

<p>I shall begin with the <i>first</i> Degree of this
Disease, and prove from authentic Evidences, it
was anciently call’d the <i>Brenning</i> or <i>Burning</i>;
and that this Word has been successively continu’d
for many Hundreds of Years, to signify
the same Disease we now call a <i>Clap</i>; and
that it was not discontinu’d till that Appellation
first began to have its Rise. The most likely
Method to accomplish my Design, will be first
to examine those Records that relate to the
<i>Stews</i>, which were by Authority allowed to be
kept on the <i>Bank-Side</i> in <i>Southwark</i>, under the
Jurisdiction of the Bp. of <i>Winchester</i>, and
which were suppressed the <i>37th</i> of <i>Hen.</i> VIII.
For it is impossible but, if there were any such
Distemper in being at that Time, it must be
pretty common among those lewd Women who
had a Licence for entertaining their Paramours,
notwithstanding any Rules or Orders which
might be establish’d to prevent its Increase:
But if we shall find that there were Orders
establish’d to prevent the Spreading of such a
Disease, that Persons might be secure from any
contagious Malady after their Entertainment at
those Houses (which were anciently 18 in
Number, but in the Reign of <i>Hen.</i> VII. reduced
to 12) we may then securely depend
upon it, that it was the Frequency of the Disease
that put those who had the Authority, under
a necessity of making such Rules and Orders.
For the same Powers, who granted a Liberty for
keeping open such lewd Houses, must find it
their Interest to secure, as much as possible, all
Persons from receiving any Injury there; lest
the Frequency of such Misfortunes should deter
others from frequenting them, and so the original
Design of their Institution cease; from the
entire sinking of the Revenues. Now I find
that, as early as the Year 1162, divers Constitutions
relating to the Lordship of <i>Winchester</i>,
(being also confirmed by the King) were to be
kept for ever, according to the old Customs that
had been Time out of Mind. Among which
these were some, <i>viz.</i> 1. <i>No Stew-holder to
take more for a Woman’s Chamber in the Week
than 14 d.</i> 2. <i>Not to keep open his Doors upon
Holy Days.</i> 3. <i>No single Woman to be kept
against her Will, that would leave her Sin.</i> 4.
<i>No single Woman to take Money to be with any
Man, except she lie with him all Night till the
Morning.</i> 5. <i>No Stew-holder to keep any Woman
that hath the perilous Infirmity of Burning.</i>
These and many more Orders were to be strictly
observed, or the Offenders to be severely punished.
Now we are assured, there is no other Disease
that can be communicated by <i>Carnal-Conversation</i>
with Women, but that which is <i>Venereal</i>,
by reason that only is contagious; and its evident
the <i>Burning</i> was certainly so: For, had
it been nothing else but some simple Ulceration,
Heat, or Inflammation, there would have been
no Contagion; and that affecting only the Woman,
could not be communicated by any <i>Venereal
Congress</i>, and so not infer a Necessity of
her being comprehended under the restraining
Article. These Orders likewise prove the Disease
was much more ancient than the Date
above-mentioned; because they were only a
Renewal of such as had been before established
Time out of Mind.</p>


<p>But to confirm this farther, I find that in the
Custody of the Bp. of <i>Winchester</i>, whose Palace
was situate on the <i>Bank-side</i>, near the <i>Stews</i>,
was a Book written upon Vellum, the Title of
which runs thus: <i>Here begynne the Ordinances,
Rules, and Customs, as well for the Salvation of
Mannes Life, as for to aschew many Mischiefs
and Inconvenients that daily be lik there for to fall
out, to be rightfully kept, and due Execution of them
to be done unto any Person within the same.</i> One
of the Articles begins thus: <i>De his qui custodiunt
Mulieres habentes Nephandam infirmitatem.</i>
It goes on, <i>Item, That no Stew-holder keep noo
Woman wythin his House, that hath any Sickness of</i>
BRENNING, <i>but that she be put out upon the peyne
of makeit a fine unto the Lord of a hundred Shillings</i>.
This is taken from the Original Manuscript,
which was preserv’d in the Bishop’s
Court, suppos’d to be written about the Year
1430. From these Orders we may observe the
Frequency of the Distemper at that Time;
which, with other Inconveniences, was <i>dayly
like there for to fall out</i>: and the Greatness of
the Penalty, as the Value of Money then was,
that is laid on it, proves it was no trifling or
insignificant thing.</p>

<p>But the bare Proof of there having been
anciently such a Disease as was called the <i>Burning</i>,
may be thought to be insufficient, unless we
were perfectly assured what it was, and how it
was in those Times described: I shall therefore
do it from an unquestionable Authority, which
is that of <i>John Arden</i>, Esq; who was one of
the Surgeons to King <i>Richard</i> II. and likewise
to King <i>Henry</i> IV. In a curious Manuscript
of his upon Vellum, he defines it to be,
a certain inward Heat and Excoriation of the
<i>Urethra</i>; which Description gives us a perfect
Idea of what we now call a <i>Clap</i>; for frequent
Dissections of those who laboured under that
Disease, have made it evident, that their <i>Urethra</i>
is excoriated by the Virulency of the Matter
they receive from the infected Woman; and
this Excoriation or Ulceration is not confined
to the <i>Ostiola</i> or Mouths of the <i>Glandulæ
Muscosæ</i> as has been lately thought, but may
equally alike attack any Part of the <i>Urethra</i>
not beyond the reach of the impelled malignant
Matter. The Heat before described, which
these Persons are sensible of, as well now as formerly,
is a Consequent of the excoriated <i>Urethra</i>;
for the Salts contained in the Urine must
necessarily prick and irritate the nervous <i>Fibrillæ</i>,
and excite a Heat in those Parts of the <i>Urethra</i>
which are divested of its natural Membrane;
which Heat will always be observed to be more
or less, as the Salts are diluted with a greater or
less Quantity of Urine; a thing I have often observed
in Persons who have laboured under this
Infirmity in hot Weather, when the perspirable
Matter being thrown off in greater Quantities,
the Salts bear a greater Proportion to the Quantity
of Urine, and thereby make its Discharge at that
Time so much the more painful and troublesome.</p>

<p>Thus we see this very early and plain Description
of this Disease among us, to be entirely
conformable to the latest and most exact Anatomical
Discoveries. Here is no Tone of the
<i>Testicles</i> depraved, according to <i>Trajanus Petronius</i>;
no Exulceration of the <i>Parastatæ</i>, according
to <i>Rondeletius</i>; no Ulceration of the
<i>Seminal Vessels</i>, according to <i>Platerus</i>; no Seat
of the Disease in the <i>Vesiculæ Seminales</i>, or
<i>Prostatæ</i>, according to <i>Bartholin</i>; nor in those
Parts and the Testicles at the same Time, according
to our Countryman <i>Wharton</i> and others,
who have falsly fixed the Seat of this Disease,
and whose Notions, in this respect, are now
justly exploded; but a single and true Description
of it, and its Situation, about 150
Years before any of those Gentlemen obliged
the World with their learned Labours.</p>

<p>Having, I hope, sufficiently made it appear,
the <i>Burning</i> was a Disease very early among us,
and given the Description of it, I shall proceed
to say something of the ancient Method that
was made use of to cure it. We are not to
expect the Measures our Predecessors, in those
early Times, made use of, should be calculated
for the removing any Malignity in the Mass
of Blood, or other Juices, according to the Practice
in Venereal Cases at this Time; because
they looked upon the Disease to be entirely
local, and the Whole of the Cure to depend
upon the Removal of the Symptoms: Hence
it was they recommended such Remedies as
were accommodated to the taking off the inward
Heat of the Part, and cure the Excoriations or
Ulcerations of the <i>Urethra</i>. The Process for
the accomplishing of this, I shall set down from
the before-mentioned <i>John Arden</i>, who wrote
about the Year 1380, His Words are as follow:
<i>Contra Incendium. Item contra Incendium Virgæ
Virilis interius ex calore &amp; excoriatione, fiat talis
Syringa</i> (i.&nbsp;e. <i>Injectio</i>) <i>lenitiva. Accipe Lac
mulieris masculum nutrientis, &amp; parum zucarium,
Oleum violæ &amp; ptisanæ, quibus commixtis
per Syringam infundator, &amp; si prædictis admiscueris
lac Amigdalarum melior erit medicina.</i>
There is no doubt but this Remedy, being used
to our Patients at this Time, would infallibly
take off the inward Heat of the Part, and cure
the Excoriations or Ulcerations of the <i>Urethra</i>,
by which means what issued from thence would
be entirely stopt: and this was all they expected
from their Medicines, forasmuch as they were
entirely unacquainted with the Nature of the
Distemper; and did not in the least imagine,
but if the Symptoms that first attack’d the Part
were removed, the Patient was entirely cured.</p>

<p>I shall now, as a farther Confirmation of
what I have advanced, proceed to prove, that by
this <i>Brenning</i> or <i>Burning</i> is meant the <i>Venereal
Disease</i>, by demonstrating that succeeding
Historians, Physical and Chirurgical Writers,
and others, have all along with us in <i>England</i>
used the very same Word to signify the Venereal
Malady. In an old Manuscript, I have,
written about the Year 1390. is a Receipt for
<i>Brenning of the Pyntyl, yat Men clepe ye
Apegalle</i>; <i>Galle</i> being an old English Word for
a running Sore. They who know the <i>Etymology</i>
of the Word <i>Apron</i>, cannot be ignorant
of this. And in another Manuscript, written
about 50 Years after, is a Receipt for <i>Burning</i>
in that Part by a Woman. <i>Simon Fish</i>, a
zealous Promoter of the <i>Reformation</i> in the
Reign of <i>Hen.</i> VIII. in his Supplication of
Beggars, presented to the King, in 1530, says
as follows, <i>These be they</i> (speaking of the <i>Romish
Priests</i>) <i>that corrupt the whole Generation of
Mankind in your Realm, that catch the Pockes
of one Woman and bear them to another; that
be</i> Burnt <i>with one Woman and bear it to another;
that catch the Lepry of one Woman and bare it
unto another</i>. But to make this Matter still
more evident, I am to observe, that <i>Andrew
Boord, M.&nbsp;D.</i> and Romish Priest, in the same
Reign, in a Book he wrote, entitl’d <i>The Breviary
of Health</i>, printed in 1546, speaks very particularly
of this sort of <i>Burning</i>; one of his
Chapters beginneth thus, <i>The 19th Chapiter doth
shew of</i> BURNING <i>of an Harlot</i>; where his
Notion of communicating the <i>Burning</i> is very
particular. He adds, that if a Man be <i>Burnt</i>
with an <i>Harlot</i>, and do meddle with another
Woman within a Day, he shall <i>Burn</i> her; and
as an immediate Remedy against the <i>Burning</i>, he
recommends the washing the <i>Pudenda</i> 2 or 3
times with White Wine, or else with Sack and
Water; but if the Matter have continued long,
to go to an expert Surgeon for Help. In his
82d <i>Chapter</i>, he speaks of <i>two</i> sorts of <i>Burning</i>,
the <i>One</i> by <i>Fire</i>, and the <i>Other</i> by a <i>Woman</i>
thro’ carnal Copulation, and refers the Person
that is <i>Burnt</i> of a <i>Harlot</i> to another Chapter
of his for Advice, what to do, <i>yf he get a
Dorser or two</i>, so called from its Protuberancy
or bunching out: For I find about that Time
the Word <i>Bubo</i> was mostly made use of, to
signify that sort of Swelling which usually happens
in pestilential Diseases.</p>

<p>From hence it appears, the <i>Burning</i>, by its
Consequents, was <i>Venereal</i>; since every Day’s
Experience makes it evident, that the ill Treatment
of the first Symptoms of the Disease,
either by astringent Medicines, or the removing
them by cooling and healing the excoriated
Parts, will generally be attended with such
Swellings in the Groin, which we rarely observe
to happen from any other Cause whatsoever.</p>

<p>I shall give a few more Instances of this
Disease being call’d the <i>Burning</i>, and conclude.
In a Manuscript I have of the Vocation of
<i>John Bale</i> to the Bishoprick of <i>Ossory</i> in
<i>Ireland</i>, written by himself, he speaks of Dr.
<i>Hugh Weston</i> (who was Dean of <i>Windsor</i> in
1556. but deprived by Cardinal <i>Pole</i> for Adultery)
as follows; “At this Day is lecherous
<i>Weston</i>, who is more practised in the Art of
<i>Brech-Burning</i> than all the <i>Whores</i> of the
<i>Stews</i>. And again, speaking of the same
Person, he says, “He not long ago <i>brent</i> a
<i>Beggar</i> in St. <i>Botolph</i>’s Parish. The same
Author says of him elsewhere, “He had ben
<i>sore Bitten</i> with a <i>Winchester Goose</i>, and was
not yet healed thereof; which was a common
Phrase for the Pox at that Time, because the <i>Stews</i>
were under the Jurisdiction of the Bishop of
<i>Winchester</i>. <i>Mich. Wood</i>, in his <i>Epistle</i> before
<i>Stephen Gardiner</i>’s Oration <i>de vera Obedientia</i>,
printed at <i>Rhoan</i>, 1553. gives another Evidence
of the <i>Burning</i>. And <i>William Bullein</i>, a
Physician in the Reign of Queen <i>Eliz.</i> in a Book
he publish’d, call’d <i>The Bulwark of Defence, &amp;c.</i>
printed in 1562. bringing in <i>Sickness</i> demanding
of <i>Health</i> what he should do with a Disease
call’d the <i>French Pockes</i>, <i>Health</i> answers, “<i>He
would not that any should fishe for this Disease,
or to be bold when he is bitten to thynke thereby
to be helped, but rather to eschewe the Cause of
thys Infirmity, and filthy rotten Burning of
Harlots.</i></p>

<p class="ml1em"><em class="gesperrt"><i>SIR</i></em>,</p>

<p class="dropcap"><em class="gesperrt">BEFORE</em> I engage farther, in proving
that the <i>Venereal Disease</i>, when it came
to be confirmed, was frequently known among
us some hundreds of Years before the Siege of
<i>Naples</i>: I shall endeavour to refute the Opinion
of those Persons, who believe it to have had
its Rise there, if any such shall remain. True
indeed it is, that there have not been wanting
several modern Authors, who have asserted it;
but I determine to make it appear to be an Error
as inconsiderately, and hastily received, as started
by some Chimerical Author; who, because
several Writers about that time, observing the
Disease to begin in the <i>Pudenda</i>, separated it
from another, with which it was before confounded,
must likewise take upon him to assert
its being a <i>new</i> Distemper, and to assign a certain
Time and Place for its Rise. Now one might
with all the Reason in the World expect, that
if the Disease had its Original there, it must
have been so certainly and infallibly known,
that there could have been no doubtful or uncertain
Opinions about it, but that the Physicians,
who resided <i>in</i> or <i>near</i> the Place, and those
more especially, who interested themselves so
far as to write of it, must have, all of them to
a Man, agreed upon the Certainty of a thing,
the Knowledge of the Truth of which was
so easily attainable. But on the contrary,
<i>Nicholas Leonicenus</i>, who was the first <i>Italian</i>
Physician, that wrote of this Disease, and who
lived at the very time, when <i>Naples</i> was besieged,
is so far from acknowledging it to have had its
Rise there, from the <i>French</i> Soldiers Conversation
with the <i>Italian</i> Women, and so little did he
know of its true Cause, that he does not allow
it to be the Consequent of impure Embraces.
About this time it was likewise, that Pope
<i>Alexander</i> the VIth engaged <i>Gaspar Torella</i> to
write of this Distemper. This Pope was in
League with <i>Alphonsus</i> King of <i>Naples</i>, against
<i>Charles</i> VIII. King of <i>France</i>, to prevent his
passing thro’ <i>Italy</i>, when he went to besiege
<i>Naples</i>; yet this Author is so far from allowing
it to have had its Original there, that he tells us,
the Astrologers were of opinion, that it proceeded
from I know not what particular Constellations.
Nor does <i>Sebastianus Aquilanus</i>, who lived at
that time, allow it to be any other than an ancient
Disease; or <i>Antonius Scanarolius</i>, who wrote
in 1498, which was but 4 or 5 Years after that
Siege. Nor do several other Authors, then
living, say one Word about this <i>Neapolitan</i>
Story. But it seems <i>Ulricus de Hutten</i>, a
<i>German</i> Kt. no Physician, positively affirms
this Disease to have had its Rise there; but how
he should come to know this, who lived at
such a distance from the Place, and they, who
were Physicians residing as it were upon the
Spot, be ignorant of it, will be as much credited,
as his following inconsistent Relation, which
will sufficiently prove, how little care he took
to be apprised of the Truth of what he wrote.
This very Author tells us, the Disease was unknown
till the Year 1493, or thereabouts; that
he himself had it, when he was a Child, and so
consequently that it was hereditary, or from the
Nurse. He Wrote his Book of this Distemper at
<i>Mentz</i>, where it was printed by <i>John Scheffer</i> in
4<i>to</i>, 1519. Now if we allow him to be but 27
Years of Age, when he wrote, (for he cannot be
suppos’d to be less, who before this took upon him
to cure his Father of the <i>Venereal Disease</i>, without
the Assistance of any Physician or Surgeon,)
he must have had the Distemper upon him,
according to his own Account, before ever it
was in being. Thus we may see, how Persons
may be impos’d upon by a hasty and inconsistent
Writer, no way qualified for such an Undertaking,
and greedily receive in Falshoods instead
of Truths, if they will not be at the Pains of
consulting the Original Writings of our Predecessors,
the only sure Method of overthrowing
such chimerical and imaginary Notions.</p>

<p>I have in my former Letters, to Dr. <span class="smcap">Douglass</span>,
sufficiently I think proved that the <i>first</i>
Degree of the <i>Venereal Disease</i> was very common
among us some hundreds of Years before it
is commonly said to have been known in <i>Europe</i>;
there will be no Reason for any body to conceive
we were at that time in any measure Strangers
to it, when it came to be confirmed;
more especially, when we consider the Methods
of Treatment in those Times, which consisting
principally in topical Applications, many of
their Patients could not possibly escape having
it confirmed on them. Now when it was in
this confirmed State, the Writers of those early
times looked upon it as an <i>entirely new</i> Disease,
and not a Consequent of any Evil before contracted,
because they were not apprised, that the
<i>first</i> Symptoms being removed, and the Disease
to Appearance cured, it should afterwards discover
it self in such a manner, as should not seem
to have the least Analogy with the Symptoms,
that first attack’d a part which had been for a
considerable time free from any Misfortune.
But because the Symptoms are the only true
Characteristicks, whereby we are infallibly able
to know one Disease from another, it may be
expected, that I produce sufficient Authorities
to demonstrate they were all of them known
and described by ancient Physical and Chirurgical
Writers, just as they appear to be in the
<i>Venereal Disease</i> at this Day, if I would prove
that <i>Disease</i> to be of a much more ancient
Date, than is generally thought; and if I do
this, I cannot but think it will be satisfactory,
since we can have no other way of coming to a
Knowledge of any one Distemper, than by its
Symptoms. The Method of laying down the
exact Succession of them, will be impossible to
be reduced to any certain and infallible Rule,
there being so great a Variety of Causes, that
obstruct such a Regularity; for which Reason,
I shall take notice of them in such Order as they
most generally appear, which was upon no account
to be expected from our antient Writers,
insomuch as they mention every particular
Symptom by it self, not knowing but that they
were independent of each other, and that each
of them was a distinct Disease. However, the
proving these Symptoms were in being in these
<i>early</i> times, will be as strong an Argument to
prove the Antiquity of this Distemper, as if
they had been register’d in the most exact Order
of Succession, because we shall, upon the strictest
Examination, find they are peculiar to the
<i>Venereal Malady</i> only. I have, I hope, sufficiently
made it appear in my former Letter, that
the <i>first Degree</i> of this <i>Disease</i> was anciently
known among us by the name of <i>Brening</i>, or
<i>Burning</i>; and that it was the same Thing with
what we now call a <i>Clap</i>, The Symptoms,
which are usually its Concomitants, are the
<i>Phymosis</i>, and <i>Parahphymosis</i>, both which are
accurately described, and proper Remedies, for
them set down by <i>John Arden</i>, Esq; in another
Manuscript of his, curiously written upon
Vellum, and beautifully illuminated. The
imprudent Method of Cure of this <i>first Degree</i>
of the <i>Venereal Malady</i>, is sometimes attended
with a Caruncle in the <i>Urethra</i>, which was a
Disease very common among us anciently: For
not to mention other <i>early</i> writers, <i>Arden</i> gives
us the Case of a certain Rector, who had such a
<i>Substance</i>, like a Wart, growing in the <i>Penis</i>,
which he says <i>frequently happens</i>, and of another
which had such an <i>Excrescence</i> as big as a <i>small
Strawberry</i>, which (says he) <i>proceeded from the
corrupted Matter remaining in the</i> Urethra.
And indeed there is not any Symptom of the
<i>Venereal Disease</i>, that I find so often mentioned
as this of the <i>Caruncle</i>, insomuch that it seems
to have been more common in those <i>early Times</i>,
than at <i>this Day</i>. But this must be certainly
owing to the smooth and oily Remedies they
were continually injecting, which, by their
relaxing and softning the Fibres of the Part,
must necessarily dispose the Contexture of small
Blood Vessels, lodged at the bottom of the little
Ulcerations, to fill with nutritious Juices, and
to extend themselves so, as to form such fungous
Excrescences; and so solicitous were they for
removing these Inconveniences, that they made
use of several Ways by Corrosives and other
Methods, to accomplish this end; and a very
early Writer among us, has given a very methodical
and curious Tract on this Subject,
wherein he recommends the removing them by
the <i>medicated-Candle</i>, which we use at this Day,
and lays down divers other Instructions, in
relation to it, which makes it probably the best
Discourse on this Subject, that was ever yet
written. He takes notice of those <i>contumacious-Ulcers</i>,
which happen upon the <i>Glans</i> and the
neighbouring Parts, which we now call <i>Shankers</i>;
and the great Trouble our ancient Authors
found in attempting their Cure, sufficiently discover
them to have had their Original from a
Venereal Infection. These several Symptoms
of the <i>Venereal-Malady</i> our <i>early</i> Writers are
very full in their Accounts of, and others, when
the <i>Disease</i> was in a more confirmed State, to
which they appropriated particular Names,
perhaps more significant and expressive than
those imposed by <i>modern</i> Authors. Thus the
<i>Buboes</i> in the <i>Groin</i> they called <i>Dorsers</i>, which
I have given a Reason for before; and the <i>Venereal-Nodes</i>
on the <i>Shin-Bones</i> they termed the
<i>Boon-haw</i>, which gives us a perfect Idea, not only
of the Part affected, but after what manner it
was diseased; for the old English Word <i>Hawe</i>,
signified a Swelling of any Part. Thus for
instance, a little Swelling upon the <i>Cornea</i>, was
anciently called the <i>Hawe</i> in the <i>Eye</i>; and the
Swelling that frequently happens on the Finger,
on one side the Nail, was called the <i>White-Hawe</i>,
and afterwards <i>Whitflaw</i>. The <i>Process</i> this
Author recommends, for the Cure of the <i>Boon</i>
or <i>Bone-Hawe</i>, is by making use of a Plaister,
which had a Hole cut in the midst, to circumscribe
it; and applying a <i>Caustic</i> of unslacked
Lime, and black Soap incorporated together;
which Plaister and Bandage were to be secured
on the part 4 Hours, and longer, if that was
not found sufficient: After this he proceeds to
the separating the <i>Slough, &amp;c.</i> This Practice
of his seems to have been found out by accident.
For he tells us, when he was a young
Practitioner, he having applyed both the Natural
and Artificial <i>Arsenic</i> to the Leg of a Man,
who was his Patient, it so mortified the Flesh,
as surprized him; but by proper Digestives, the
<i>Eschar</i> coming off, and leaving the Bone bare,
he scraped it with an Instrument for several
Days, and drest it with Incarnatives, designing
to have ingendred Flesh on it; but this proving
unsuccessful, he continued to scrape it, till he
observed it move under the Instrument; after
which having separated it, he found the Sore
covered with new Flesh, and that the Bone was
4 Inches in length, 2 in breadth, and very thick,
upon the Removal of which the Patient was
soon cured. Thus it’s probable this Observation
of this great Man led our Predecessors to practice
the very same Method; and we do at <i>this
Day</i> in our Hospitals treat the <i>Venereal Nodes</i> on
the <i>Shins</i> exactly as is here described, where we
observe the same Appearances, he so long before
took notice of; and it is not in the least to be
doubted, but the <i>Boon-Haw</i> and our <i>Venereal
Nodes</i> are the same <i>Disease</i>. By the Appearance
of some of the last of these Symptoms, we
infallibly judge the Patient has had the Infection
upon him a considerable time, and that
the <i>Disease</i> is making its gradual Advances, to
the corrupting and destroying the whole Frame
of the Body. That this was the Conclusion of
the Miseries of those Persons, who gave themselves
up to the deceitful-Delights and Entertainments
of lewd-Women, in those <i>early-times</i>
as well as <i>now</i>, I cannot better prove than by
those remarkable Instances you quoted from a
MS. in <i>Lincoln</i>-Colledge, in <i>Oxon</i>, Viz. <i>Novi
enim ego Magister</i> Thomas Gascoigne, <i>licet
indignus sacræ Theologiæ Doctor, qui hæc scripsi
&amp; collegi, diversos viros, qui mortui fuerunt ex
putrefactione membrorum suorum genitalium &amp;
corporis sui; quœ corruptio &amp; putrefactio, ut
ipsi dixerunt, causata fuit per exercitium copulæ
carnalis cum mulieribus. Magnus enim dux in
Anglia, scil.</i> J. de Gaunt, <i>mortuus est ex tali
putrefactione membrorum genitalium, &amp; corporis
sui, causatâ per frequentationem mulierum.
Magnus enim fornicator fuit, ut in toto Regno
Angliæ divulgabatur, &amp; ante mortem suam jacens
sic infirmus in lecto, eandem putrefactionem Regi;
Angliæ Ricardo secundo ostendit, cum idem Rex
eundem Ducem in suâ infirmitate visitavit; &amp;
dixit mihi qui ista novit unus fidelis sacræ Theologiæ
Baccalaureus. Willus etiam longe vir maturæ
ætatis &amp; de civitat. Londonii, mortuus est ex tali
putrefactione membrorum suorum genitalium, &amp;
corporis sui, causatâ per copulam carnalem cum
Mulieribus, ut ipsemet pluries confessus est ante
mortem suam, quum manu sua propria eleemosynas
distribuit, ut ego novi, anno Dni. 1430.</i> Now
what those Instances mentioned from <i>Arden</i>,
or these from <i>Gascoigne</i>, who was then Chancellor
of <i>Oxford</i>, could possibly be, but <i>Venereal-Cases</i>,
I would be obliged to any body to inform
me. Certain it is, no <i>Disease</i> was ever known
to be gotten by the carnal Conversation of Women,
which first attacked the <i>Genitals</i>, causing
a Corruption and Putrefaction of them, and
afterward of the whole Frame of the Body,
but that which is <i>Venereal</i>. For nothing is
more commonly known at this Day, than that
after the Venereal-Engagement with an impure
Woman, the <i>Penis</i> is the Part where the Scene
is first laid for the succeeding Tragical Appearances;
and there, and in the Neighbouring Parts,
do the Symptoms of the Disease, as its Retainers,
always first assemble, till the malignant Poison
taint the Blood and other Juices; which being
convey’d over the whole Frame of the human
Fabric, if not check’d, soon brings about its
total Corruption.</p>

<p>We do not indeed find the <i>Disease</i> mentioned
by <i>Gascoigne</i>, was distinguish’d by any particular
Name: But great Numbers must unavoidably
die of the <i>Venereal-Malady</i> at that time,
from the imperfect Knowledge of those who
had the Treatment of the first Degrees of it. It
must necessarily follow, therefore, that when the
whole Frame of the Body had receiv’d a Taint
from the <i>Venereal-Poison</i>, so as to occasion its
breaking-out in Scabs and Ulcers, almost all over
its Surface, it must generally be called by the
Name of some particular Disease, whose Appearances
had somewhat of an Affinity to it.
Now if we examine the Nature of all the
Diseases, that attack the Human Body, we
shall not find the <i>Venereal-Malady</i>, when it
arrives at this State, to bear a greater Similitude
to any than the Leprosy, as it is described by
the Ancients: Nay, so great was the Analogy
betwixt these Diseases supposed to be, that
<i>Sebastianus Aquilanus</i> has endeavoured to prove
from <i>Galen</i>, <i>Avicen</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, &amp;c. that the <i>Pox</i>
is only one Species of the <i>Leprosy</i>; and <i>Jacobus
Cataneus</i>, a Writer almost as early as the Rise
of the Name of the <i>Pox</i>, tells us, ’tis not only
possible there may be a Transition from one of
these Diseases into the other; but that he saw
<i>two</i> Persons in whom the <i>Pox</i> was changed into
the <i>Leprosy</i>: That is, from having great <i>Pocks</i>
or <i>Pustules</i> on the Surface of their Bodies, from
whence the <i>Pox</i> is denominated, to have become
Ulcerous or Scabby. This particular State
of the Disease anciently put the Surgeons to a
great deal of Trouble: For they finding that
these Ulcers were of a very contumacious and
rebellious Nature, were obliged to make use of
great Numbers of Remedies, in order to conquer
the evil Disposition of them. But they
observed that all of them were useless, unless
Mercury was joined with them. Now the
dressing each particular Ulcer being so very
tedious, they ordered the Patients to daub the
Ointments over the Parts which were ulcerated;
which done, they were wrapt in Linnen Cloths
till the next dressing: But after a few Days they
were extreamly surprised, to find their Mouths
began to be sore, and that they spit very profusely;
but they tell us to their Astonishment,
that in a little time the Sores became healed,
and the Patients cured. And by this Accident
it was the Method of <i>Salivating</i> by <i>Unction</i>
was first discover’d, which is in so much use
among us at this Day. From these and some
other Instances I have given of the Industry and
Application of our Predecessors, and with what
Sagacity they applied every accidental Hint,
to the relieving their distressed Fellow-Creatures
from the Misfortunes they laboured under; we
ought to be led to the highest Esteem and Veneration
of them; and so much the more most
certainly forasmuch as they were principally
our own Country-Men, who, I can prove, not
only from several Persons coming from <i>Foreign-Parts</i>
to be cured of their Diseases <i>here</i>, but for
other Reasons, that they excelled most of their
Cotemporaries in the Divine Art of Healing.
Now altho’ those <i>Foreign-Authorities</i>, I before
mentioned, might be looked upon as sufficient
to convince any one, how our Ancestors blended
these <i>two</i> Diseases together; yet I shall prove
from our own Writers, long before those, that
altho’ the <i>Pox</i> was not only among us, but in
distant Nations, anciently confounded with the
<i>Leprosy</i>; yet, so exact were our Writers in their
Observations of the Infectious Nature of one
Species of that Disease, and describing the
Symptoms, as was sufficient to lead any Person
to the distinguishing between them, so as to
separate <i>one</i> Disease from the <i>other</i>. I shall
therefore <i>first</i> enquire into the manner how the
<i>Leprosy</i> was sometimes said to be gotten in those
early Times, and then examine the Symptoms
of the Disease, that attacked the Patient. <i>John
Gadisden</i>, a very learned and famous <i>English</i>
Physician, who flourished about 1340, in an
excellent Work of his, he entitles <i>Rosa Anglica</i>,
speaking <i>de Infectione ex Coitu Leprosi, vel Leprosæ</i>,
says as follows, <i>Primo notandum quod ille qui
timet de excoriatione &amp; arsura Virgæ post coitum
statim lavet Virgam cum aqua mixta aceto, vel
cum urina propria, &amp; nihil mali habebit</i>; and in
another Place speaking <i>de Ulcere Virgæ</i>, he says,
<i>Sed si quis vult membrum ab omni corruptione
servare, cum a Muliere recedit, quam forte habet
suspectam de immunditie, lavet illud cum aqua
frigida mixta cum aceto, vel urina propria, intra
vel extra preputium</i>. He likewise speaking still of
the <i>Leprosy</i>, recommends a Decoction of Plantain
and Roses in Wine, to be made use of by the
Woman immediately after the <i>Venereal-Encounter</i>;
upon which he tells us she will be secure.
From hence it is evident some of their <i>Leprous
Women</i> (as they call’d them) were capable of
communicating an infectious Malady to those
that had carnal Conversation with them; which
proves, the <i>Pudenda</i> of the Women must be
diseased, for as much as we are absolutely assured
Infections of that Nature only happen
when a sound Part comes to an immediate
Contact with a diseased one; for the Symptoms
always first display themselves in those Parts,
thro’ which the Virulency is first conveyed.
Now in a true <i>Leprosy</i> we never meet with the
mention of any Disorder in those Parts,
which, if there be not, must absolutely secure
the Person from having that Disease communicated
to him by Coition with <i>Leprous-Women</i>;
but it proves there was a Disease among
them, which was not the <i>Leprosy</i> altho’ it went
by that Name; and that this could be no other
than <i>Venereal</i>, because it was infectious; for
there is no other Disease that is capable of
being communicated this way but the <i>Venereal-Disease</i>,
seeing the <i>Pudenda</i> are only in that
Distemper so diseased as to become capable of
communicating their Contagion. I find the
learned <i>Gilbertus Anglicus</i>, who flourished about
1360, reasoning concerning the manner how
it is possible a Man should be infected by a
<i>Leprous-Woman</i>; where if we allow him to
call the <i>Malignant Matter</i>, which is lodged
in the <i>Vagina</i> [<i>the Womans seed</i>] we shall find
he acurately describes the very first <i>Venereal-Infection</i>,
by part of the virulent Matters being
received into the <i>Urethra</i>; from whence by the
Communication of the <i>Veins</i> and <i>Arteries</i>, it is
conveyed into the whole Body, after which
(<i>says he</i>) ensues its total Corruption. Let us
now examine the Symptoms of one sort of
their Leprosy, for it must be necessarily divided
into different Species, when another Distemper
was blended with it, in which we observe such
a <i>diversity</i> of <i>appearances</i>; and this I shall the
rather do in this Place, because it will furnish us
with the next Succession of Symptoms after
those already mentioned, as the <i>Venereal-Ozænas</i>,
the Ulcers of the Throat, the Hoarsness, the
proof of its being communicable from the Nurse
to the Child, by <i>Hereditary-succession, &amp;c.</i> All
which we find to be true in the <i>Venereal-Disease</i>
at this Day. Our Country-Man <i>Bartholomew
Glanvile</i>, who flourished about 1360,
in his Book <i>de Proprietatibus Rerum</i>, translated
by <i>John Trevisa</i> Vicar of <i>Barkley</i> in 1398, tells
<i>us, some</i> Leprous-Persons <i>have redde Pymples and
Whelkes in the Face, out of whom oftene runne
Blood and Matter: In such the Noses swellen and
ben grete, the virtue of smellynge falyth, and the
Brethe stynkyth ryght fowle</i>. In another place he
speaks of <i>unclene spotyd glemy and quyttery, the Nose-thrilles
ben stopyl, the wason of the Voys is rough,
and the Voys is horse and the Heere falls</i>. Among
the Causes of this sort of <i>Leprosy</i>, he reckons
lying in the Sheets after them, easing Nature
after them; and others which the first Writers
on the <i>Pox</i> looked upon to be capable of communicating
that Contagion: Also, <i>says he, it
comyth of fleshly lykeng by a Woman, after that
a</i> Leprous-Man <i>hathe laye by her; also it
comyth of Fader and Moder; ann so thys Contagyon
passyth into the Chylde as it ware
by Lawe of Herytage. And also when
a Chylde is fedde wyth corrupt Mylke
of a Leprous Nouryce.</i> He adds, <i>by what
ever Cause it comes, you are not to hope for Cure
if it be confyrmyd; but it may be somewhat hidde
and lett that it distroye so soone.</i> Thus we see
how our Author, under the Name of <i>one</i> Species
of the <i>Leprosy</i>, gives a Summary of the Symptoms
of the <i>Pox</i>, and the several ways whereby
it is at this time communicated. Now when
these <i>two</i> Diseases were anciently blended
together, and passed under the Name of the
<i>Leprosy</i> only, it must be the real Cause why
that <i>Disease</i> seemed to be so <i>rife</i> formerly; for
<i>two</i> Distempers passing under <i>one</i> Name must
necessarily make it more taken notice of and
much more frequent; not but that much the
greater Number of those who were formerly
said to be <i>Leprous</i> were really <i>Venereal</i>, seems
to be very evident; for since that <i>Disease</i> has
been separated from the <i>Leprosy</i>, it has drawn
off such vast Numbers, that the <i>Leprosy</i> is
become as it were a perfect Stranger to us.
Those who are acquainted with our English History
well know the great Provision which was
anciently made throughout all <i>England</i> for
<i>Leprous-Persons</i>, insomuch that there was
scarce a considerable Town among us but had
a <i>Lazar-House</i> for such diseased. In a Register
which belonged to one of these Houses,
I find there were in <i>Hen.</i> the VIIIth’s time
6 of them near <i>London</i>, (<i>viz</i>,) at <i>Knight’s-Bridge</i>,
<i>Hammersmith</i>, <i>Highgate</i>, <i>Kingsland</i>, the <i>Lock</i>,
and at <i>Mile-end</i>, but about 40 Years before I
find but 4 mentioned: and in 1452 in the
Will of <i>Ralph Holland</i>, Merchant-Taylor,
registred in the Prerogative Office, mention is
made but of 3, which, with his Legacies to
them, are as follow. <i>Item lego Leprosis de Lokes,
extra Barram Sti Georgii 20s. Item lego
Leprosis de Hackenay</i> (which is that at <i>Kingsland</i>)
<i>20s. Item lego Leprosis Sti Egidii extra Barram
de Holborn 40s</i>, from which it is worth while
to note, that the <i>Lock</i> beyond St. <i>Georges</i>
Church, and that at <i>Kingsland</i>, are at this time
applyed to no other use than for the Entertainment
and Cure of such as have the <i>Venereal-Malady</i>.
Some of our learned Antiquaries
have been much concerned to know the Cause
why the <i>Leprosy</i> shou’d be so common in those
early times, and so little known among us now:
But I believe the Reason will be impossible to
be assigned, unless we allow, according to the
Proofs which I have already brought, that the
<i>Venereal-Disease</i> was so blended with it, as to
make up the Number of the diseased. It seems
to have been the same thing with them in
<i>France</i> as with us: For <i>Mezeray</i> tells us, that
the House of the <i>Fathers</i> of the <i>Mission</i> of
St. <i>Lazarus</i>, was formerly an <i>Hospital</i> for
<i>Leprous-People</i>, but that Disease being ceased
in this last Age (since the <i>Pox</i> has been separated
from it) these <i>Lazar-Houses</i> have been converted
to other Uses; and it may not be perhaps
foreign to my purpose to take notice that the
Writ <i>de Leproso amovendo</i> contained in the
<i>Register of Writs</i> was (according to <i>Coke</i> upon
<i>Littleton</i>) to prevent Leprous Persons associating
themselves with their Neighbours, who appear
to be so by their Voice and their Sores; and
the Putrefaction of their Flesh; and by the
Smell of them. Well then, let us examine
what Method was to be taken to prevent this
noysom and filthy Distemper, the Leprosy;
why truly that which would infallibly prevent
their getting the <i>Pox</i> after the usual Method,
and that was Castration. It is certain that
<i>Eunuchs</i> are rarely or never troubled with the
Leprosy, according to <i>Monsieur le Prestre</i>, a
Councellor in the Parliament of <i>Paris</i>, who
has these Words, <i>Antipathia vero Elephantiasis
veneno resistit: Hinc Eunuchi &amp; quicunque sunt
mollis, frigidæ &amp; effeminatæ naturæ nunquam
aut raro Lepra corripiuntur, &amp; quidem quibus
imminet Lepræ periculum de consilio medicorum
sibi virilia amputare permittitur</i>. (Cent. I. Cap.
6. de Separatione ex causa Luis Venerea.) And
<i>Mezeray</i> says, he has read in the Life of <i>Philip</i>
the <i>August</i>, that some Men had such Apprehensions
of the <i>Leprosy</i>, (that shameful and
nasty Distemper) that to preserve themselves
from it, they made themselves <i>Eunuchs</i>. Now
it is highly probable that those Persons who
submitted to such a painful Operation, having
before observed, that those who gave themselves
up to a free and unrestrained use of Women,
fell at length under such unhappy circumstances;
and so found the only measures to preserve
themselves from it was to be disabled for such
engagements, which sufficiently proves this
Species of the <i>Leprosy</i> was infectious; and for
the reasons before assigned could be no other
than <i>Venereal</i>; for how the true <i>Leprosy</i> should
be prevented by such means will be, I believe,
impossible for any Person to determine. There
yet remains one very considerable Symptom of
the <i>Venereal-Malady</i> for me to take notice of,
because it is looked upon to be the most remarkable
in that Disease, which, is the falling
of the Nose; but since it has been already
proved, that this Disease when it had arrived to
such a pitch as to discover it self by those direful
Symptoms, as are the immediate forerunners of
this, was by the Ancients confounded with the
<i>Leprosy</i>, and called by that Name, it must be
among the Symptoms of that <i>Disease</i> we are
the most likely to meet with it, if any such
thing as the falling of the Nose was known
among them. Now the most likely Method
of coming to a certain Knowledge of the
Infallible Symptoms of the <i>Leprosy</i> of the
Ancients in its more confirmed State, is to consult
the Examinations those unhappy Persons
were obliged to undergo, before they were debarred
the Conversation of Human Society, and
committed to close confinement: But this being
a thing some Ages since laid aside, no Author
that I know of having the particular History of
it, I shall do it as briefly as I can from what
Remains I have met with in Records, and other
scattered Papers. First then, after the Persons
appointed to examine the Diseased had comforted
them, by telling them this Distemper
might prove a Spiritual Advantage; and if
they were found to be <i>Leprous</i>, it was to be
looked upon as their Purgatory in this World;
and altho’ they were denied the World, they
were chosen of God: the Person was then to
swear to answer truly to all such Questions as
they should be asked; but the Examiners were
very cautious in their Inquiries, lest a Person who
was not really <i>Leprous</i> should be committed,
which they looked upon to be an almost unpardonable
Crime: They considered the Signs
as <i>Univocal</i>, which properly belonged to that
Disease, or <i>Equivocal</i>, which might belong to
another, and did not, upon the appearance of
<i>one</i> or <i>two</i> Signs, determine the Person to be a
<i>Lazar</i>; and this I find to be the Case of the
Wife of <i>John Nightingale</i> Esq; of <i>Brentwood</i>
in <i>Essex</i>, who in the Reign of <i>Edw.</i> the IVth,
<i>An.</i> 1468, being reported to be a <i>Lazare</i>, and
that she did converse and communicate
with Persons in public and private Places, and
not (according to custom) retire herself, but
refused so to do, was accordingly examined by
<i>William Hattecliff</i>, <i>Roger Marcall</i>, and <i>Dominicus
de Serego</i> the Kings Physicians; but they
upon strict Inquiry adjudged her not to be <i>Leprous</i>,
by reason the Appearances of the Disease
were not sufficient: Some of the Questions put
to the <i>Leprous-Persons</i>, which will more fully
confirm what I have before advanced, I shall
now give as I transcribed them from an Ancient
Book of Surgery, <i>yf there were any of his lygnage
that he knew to be</i> Lazares <i>and especially their
Faders and Moders; for by any other of their
Kynred they ought not to be</i> Lazares, <i>then ought
ye to enquire yf he hath had the Company of any
lepress Woman, and yf any</i> Lazare <i>had medled
with her afore him; and lately because of the
infect matter and contagyous filth, that she had
received of him. Also his nostrils be wyde outward,
narrow within and gnawn. Also yf his
lips and gummes are foul stynking and coroded,
Also yf his voice be horse, and as he speaketh in
the nose.</i> Now the Signs which are here mentioned,
were looked upon to be <i>Univocal</i>: And
these were they who made the <i>Examiners</i> principally
determine the Persons to be <i>Leprous</i>;
but what Determinations any one would immediately
give from such Symptoms now, no
Person is surely ignorant of. But even these
certain appearances would not always satisfy
some Persons, if we may believe <i>Fælix Platenus</i>
in his <i>Medicinal</i> and <i>Chirurgical</i> Observations,
<i>Lib.</i> 3. who tells us, some did not look upon
them to be so, till they had an horrible aspect,
were <i>hoarse</i> and <i>Noses</i> fell. Likewise in the
<i>Examen Leprosorum</i> printed in the <i>De Chirurgia
Scriptores Optimi</i>, the Author speaking of
the <i>Signs</i> of the <i>Leprosy</i> relating to the <i>Nose</i>,
begins thus, <i>Si nares exterius secundum exteriorem
partem ingrossentur, &amp; interius constringantur,
&amp; coarctentur, secundo si appareat cartilaginis in
medio corosio, et casus ejus significat Lepram
incurabilem</i>. And the before mentioned <i>John
Gadisden</i> in his Chapter <i>de Lepra</i> says as follows,
<i>Signa confirmationis etiam incurabiliter sunt
corrosio cartilaginis quæ est inter foramina &amp;
casus ejusdem</i>. Thus, Sir, have I proved we had
a Distemper amongus some hundreds of Years
before the <i>Venereal-Disease</i> is said to have been
known in <i>Europe</i>, which was called the <i>Burning</i>;
that this <i>Burning</i> was <i>Infectious</i>, and that it
was the <i>first Degree</i> of the <i>Venereal Disease</i>;
that this being common at that time, from their
Method of Treatment; the <i>Pox</i> must be
unavoidable: That it had exactly the same Appearances
it has now, altho’ they were generally
called by <i>different</i> Names, that the Ancients confounded
it with the <i>Leprosy</i>; that the vast
Numbers of <i>Leprous-Persons</i> among us, before
the <i>Venereal-Disease</i> was separated from it,
and the small Number we observe at this Time,
is a flagrant Proof of the former; that in describing
the <i>Symptoms</i> of the <i>Leprosy</i>, they give
us those of the <i>Venereal Malady</i>; and, by mentioning
how it is communicated, they describe
the Ways by which the <i>Pox</i> is gotten at this
Day; that such Remedies were by them
recommended to prevent the <i>first</i> Attack
of the <i>Leprosy</i>, as are at this Time in
Use to prevent the <i>first</i> Symptoms of the <i>Pox</i>;
and that the falling of the <i>Nose</i>, which has been
look’d upon to be the most remarkable Symptom
of the <i>Venereal-Disease</i>, was commonly observed
in what they called the <i>Leprosy</i> in former Ages.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
